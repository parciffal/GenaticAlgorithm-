34,to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
119,dedication for mr lee and alice in consideration of love affection lawyers i suppose were children once
108,charles lamb chapter  when he was nearly thirteen my brother jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow
142,when it healed and jems fears of never being able to play football were assuaged he was seldom selfconscious about his injury
184,his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right when he stood or walked the back of his hand was at right angles to his body his thumb parallel to his thigh
65,he couldnt have cared less so long as he could pass and punt
130,when enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident
126,i maintain that the ewells started it all but jem who was four years my senior said it started long before that
120,he said it began the summer dill came to us when dill first gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
91,i said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing it really began with andrew jackson
156,if general jackson hadnt run the creeks up the creek simon finch would never have paddled up the alabama and where would we be if he hadnt
89,we were far too old to settle an argument with a fistfight so we consulted atticus
38,our father said we were both right
161,being southerners it was a source of shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the battle of hastings
126,all we had was simon finch a furtrapping apothecary from cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess
329,in england simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren and as simon called himself a methodist he worked his way across the atlantic to philadelphia thence to jamaica thence to mobile and up the saint stephens
299,mindful of john wesleys strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling simon made a pile practicing medicine but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he knew was not for the glory of god as the putting on of gold and costly apparel
258,so simon having forgotten his teachers dictum on the possession of human chattels bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks of the alabama river some forty miles above saint stephens
125,he returned to saint stephens only once to find a wife and with her established a line that ran high to daughters
47,simon lived to an impressive age and died rich
134,it was customary for the men in the family to remain on simons homestead finchs landing and make their living from cotton
259,the place was selfsufficient modest in comparison with the empires around it the landing nevertheless produced everything required to sustain life except ice wheat flour and articles of clothing supplied by riverboats from mobile
413,simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north and the south as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century when my father atticus finch went to montgomery to read law and his younger brother went to boston to study medicine
215,their sister alexandra was the finch who remained at the landing she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trotlines were full
91,when my father was admitted to the bar he returned to maycomb and began his practice
92,maycomb some twenty miles east of finchs landing was the county seat of maycomb county
148,atticuss office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack a spittoon a checkerboard and an unsullied code of alabama
90,his first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the maycomb county jail
247,atticus had urged them to accept the states generosity in allowing them to plead guilty to seconddegree murder and escape with their lives but they were haverfords in maycomb county a name synonymous with jackass
311,the haverfords had dispatched maycomb s leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare were imprudent enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses and insisted that thesonofabitchhadit comingtohim was a good enough defense for anybody
316,they persisted in pleading not guilty to firstdegree murder so there was nothing much atticus could do for his clients except be present at their departure an occasion that was probably the beginning of my fathers profound distaste for the practice of criminal law
186,during his first five years in maycomb atticus practiced economy more than anything for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brothers education
239,john hale finch was ten years younger than my father and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing but after getting uncle jack started atticus derived a reasonable income from the law
235,he liked maycomb he was maycomb county born and bred he knew his people they knew him and because of simon finchs industry atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town
79,maycomb was an old town but it was a tired old town when i first knew it
118,in rainy weather the streets turned to red slop grass grew on the sidewalks the courthouse sagged in the square
186,somehow it was hotter then a black dog suffered on a summers day bony mules hitched to hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square
52,mens stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning
158,ladies bathed before noon after their threeoclock naps and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum
24,people moved slowly then
116,they ambled across the square shuffled in and out of the stores around it took their time about everything
52,a day was twentyfour hours long but seemed longer
162,there was no hurry for there was nowhere to go nothing to buy and no money to buy it with nothing to see outside the boundaries of maycomb county
155,but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself
98,we lived on the main residential street in town  atticus jem and i plus calpurnia our cook
117,jem and i found our father satisfactory he played with us read to us and treated us with courteous detachment
37,calpurnia was something else again
121,she was all angles and bones she was nearsighted she squinted her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard
193,she was always ordering me out of the kitchen asking me why i couldnt behave as well as jem when she knew he was older and calling me home when i wasnt ready to come
35,our battles were epic and onesided
66,calpurnia always won mainly because atticus always took her side
126,she had been with us ever since jem was born and i had felt her tyrannical presence as long as i could remember
64,our mother died when i was two so i never felt her absence
111,she was a graham from montgomery atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature
55,he was middleaged then she was fifteen years his junior
162,jem was the product of their first year of marriage four years later i was born and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack
30,they said it ran in her family
40,i did not miss her but i think jem did
160,he remembered her clearly and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length then go off and play by himself behind the carhouse
56,when he was like that i knew better than to bother him
250,when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten our summertime boundaries within calling distance of calpurnia were mrs henry lafayette duboses house two doors to the north of us and the radley place three doors to the south
36,we were never tempted to break them
168,the radley place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for days on end mrs dubose was plain hell
37,that was the summer dill came to us
156,early one morning as we were beginning our days play in the back yard jem and i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfords collard patch
155,we went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy  miss rachels rat terrier was expecting  instead we found someone sitting looking at us
54,sitting down he wasnt much higher than the collards
36,we stared at him until he spoke hey
37, hey yourself said jem pleasantly
35,im charles baker harris he said
43,i just thought youd like to know i can read
87,you got anything needs readin i can do it how old are you asked jem fourandahalf
14, goin on seven
60, shoot no wonder then said jem jerking his thumb at me
99,scout yonders been readin ever since she was born and she aint even started to school yet
40,you look right puny for goin on seven
32, im little but im old he said
48,jem brushed his hair back to get a better look
45,why dont you come over charles baker harris
16,lord what a name
25, s not any funniern yours
51,aunt rachel says your names jeremy atticus finch
11, jem scowled
38,im big enough to fit mine he said
26,your names longer n you are
23,bet its a foot longer
62, folks call me dill said dill struggling under the fence
57,do better if you go over it instead of under it i said
22,where d you come from
164, dill was from meridian mississippi was spending the summer with his aunt miss rachel and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on
184,his family was from maycomb county originally his mother worked for a photographer in meridian had entered his picture in a beautiful child contest and won five dollars
85,she gave the money to dill who went to the picture show twenty times on it
102,dont have any picture shows here except jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes said jem
22,ever see anything good
103, dill had seen dracula a revelation that moved jem to eye him with the beginning of respect
22,tell it to us he said
22,dill was a curiosity
187,he wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff he was a year my senior but i towered over him
178,as he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken his laugh was sudden and happy he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead
168,when dill reduced dracula to dust and jem said the show sounded better than the book i asked dill where his father was you aint said anything about him
16, i havent got one
8, is he dead
52, no then if hes not dead youve got one havent you
108, dill blushed and jem told me to hush a sure sign that dill had been studied and found acceptable
56,thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment
261,routine contentment was improving our treehouse that rested between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard fussing running through our list of dramas based on the works of oliver optic victor appleton and edgar rice burroughs
41,in this matter we were lucky to have dill
136,he played the character parts formerly thrust upon me  the ape in tarzan mr crabtree in the rover boys mr damon in tom swift
127,thus we came to know dill as a pocket merlin whose head teemed with eccentric plans strange longings and quaint fancies
171,but by the end of august our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions and it was then that dill gave us the idea of making boo radley come out
37,the radley place fascinated dill
201,in spite of our warnings and explanations it drew him as the moon draws water but drew him no nearer than the lightpole on the corner a safe distance from the radley gate
80,there he would stand his arm around the fat pole staring and wondering
61,the radley place jutted into a sharp curve beyond our house
81,walking south one faced its porch the sidewalk turned and ran beside the lot
160,the house was low was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters but had long ago darkened to the color of the slategray yard around it
86,rainrotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda oak trees kept the sun away
165,the remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard  a swept yard that was never swept  where johnson grass and rabbittobacco grew in abundance
46,inside the house lived a malevolent phantom
59,people said he existed but jem and i had never seen him
87,people said he went out at night when the moon was down and peeped in windows
88,when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap it was because he had breathed on them
66,any stealthy small crimes committed in maycomb were his work
340,once the town was terrorized by a series of morbid nocturnal events peoples chickens and household pets were found mutilated although the culprit was crazy addie who eventually drowned himself in barkers eddy people still looked at the radley place unwilling to discard their initial suspicions
128,a negro would not pass the radley place at night he would cut across to the sidewalk opposite and whistle as he walked
242,the maycomb school grounds adjoined the back of the radley lot from the radley chickenyard tall pecan trees shook their fruit into the schoolyard but the nuts lay untouched by the children radley pecans would kill you
86,a baseball hit into the radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked
73,the misery of that house began many years before jem and i were born
99,the radleys welcome anywhere in town kept to themselves a predilection unforgivable in maycomb
255,they did not go to church maycombs principal recreation but worshiped at home mrs radley seldom if ever crossed the street for a midmorning coffee break with her neighbors and certainly never joined a missionary circle
210,mr radley walked to town at eleventhirty every morning and came back promptly at twelve sometimes carrying a brown paper bag that the neighborhood assumed contained the family groceries
235,i never knew how old mr radley made his living  jem said he bought cotton a polite term for doing nothing  but mr radley and his wife had lived there with their two sons as long as anybody could remember
171,the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only
129,of all days sunday was the day for formal afternoon visiting ladies wore corsets men wore coats children wore shoes
124,but to climb the radley front steps and call hey of a sunday afternoon was something their neighbors never did
36,the radley house had no screen doors
84,i once asked atticus if it ever had any atticus said yes but before i was born
328,according to neighborhood legend when the younger radley boy was in his teens he became acquainted with some of the cunninghams from old sarum an enormous and confusing tribe domiciled in the northern part of the county and they formed the nearest thing to a gang ever seen in maycomb
394,they did little but enough to be discussed by the town and publicly warned from three pulpits they hung around the barbershop they rode the bus to abbottsville on sundays and went to the picture show they attended dances at the countys riverside gambling hell the dewdrop inn amp fishing camp they experimented with stumphole whiskey
99,nobody in maycomb had nerve enough to tell mr radley that his boy was in with the wrong crowd
211,one night in an excessive spurt of high spirits the boys backed around the square in a borrowed flivver resisted arrest by maycomb s ancient beadle mr conner and locked him in the courthouse outhouse
400,the town decided something had to be done mr conner said he knew who each and every one of them was and he was bound and determined they wouldnt get away with it so the boys came before the probate judge on charges of disorderly conduct disturbing the peace assault and battery and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female
173,the judge asked mr conner why he included the last charge mr conner said they cussed so loud he was sure every lady in maycomb heard them
220,the judge decided to send the boys to the state industrial school where boys were sometimes sent for no other reason than to provide them with food and decent shelter it was no prison and it was no disgrace
24,mr radley thought it was
99,if the judge released arthur mr radley would see to it that arthur gave no further trouble
73,knowing that mr radley s word was his bond the judge was glad to do so
200,the other boys attended the industrial school and received the best secondary education to be had in the state one of them eventually worked his way through engineering school at auburn
149,the doors of the radley house were closed on weekdays as well as sundays and mr radley s boy was not seen again for fifteen years
145,but there came a day barely within jems memory when boo radley was heard from and was seen by several people but not by jem
323,he said atticus never talked much about the radleys when jem would question him atticuss only answer was for him to mind his own business and let the radleys mind theirs they had a right to but when it happened jem said atticus shook his head and said mm mm mm
135, so jem received most of his information from miss stephanie crawford a neighborhood scold who said she knew the whole thing
143,according to miss stephanie boo was sitting in the livingroom cutting some items from the maycomb tribune to paste in his scrapbook
29,his father entered the room
148,as mr radley passed by boo drove the scissors into his parents leg pulled them out wiped them on his pants and resumed his activities
194,mrs radley ran screaming into the street that arthur was killing them all but when the sheriff arrived he found boo still sitting in the livingroom cutting up the tribune
37,he was thirtythree years old then
169,miss stephanie said old mr radley said no radley was going to any asylum when it was suggested that a season in tuscaloosa might be helpful to boo
49,boo wasnt crazy he was highstrung at times
138,it was all right to shut him up mr radley conceded but insisted that boo not be charged with anything he was not a criminal
119,the sheriff hadnt the heart to put him in jail alongside negroes so boo was locked in the courthouse basement
82,boos transition from the basement to back home was nebulous in jems memory
151,miss stephanie crawford said some of the town council told mr radley that if he didnt take boo back boo would die of mold from the damp
67,besides boo could not live forever on the bounty of the county
177,nobody knew what form of intimidation mr radley employed to keep boo out of sight but jem figured that mr radley kept him chained to the bed most of the time
109,atticus said no it wasnt that sort of thing that there were other ways of making people into ghosts
146,my memory came alive to see mrs radley occasionally open the front door walk to the edge of the porch and pour water on her cannas
74,but every day jem and i would see mr radley walking to and from town
93,he was a thin leathery man with colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light
98,his cheekbones were sharp and his mouth was wide with a thin upper lip and a full lower lip
178,miss stephanie crawford said he was so upright he took the word of god as his only law and we believed her because mr radleys posture was ramrod straight
21,he never spoke to us
104,when he passed we would look at the ground and say good morning sir and he would cough in reply
152,mr radleys elder son lived in pensacola he came home at christmas and he was one of the few persons we ever saw enter or leave the place
74,from the day mr radley took arthur home people said the house died
192,but there came a day when atticus told us hed wear us out if we made any noise in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a sound out of us
18,mr radley was dying
25,he took his time about it
154,wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the radley lot straw was put down on the sidewalk traffic was diverted to the back street
112,dr reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the radleys every time he called
41,jem and i crept around the yard for days
143,at last the sawhorses were taken away and we stood watching from the front porch when mr radley made his final journey past our house
121,there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia and she spat meditatively into the yard
96,we looked at her in surprise for calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people
194,the neighborhood thought when mr radley went under boo would come out but it had another think coming boos elder brother returned from pensacola and took mr radleys place
65,the only difference between him and his father was their ages
47,jem said mr nathan radley bought cotton too
147,mr nathan would speak to us however when we said good morning and sometimes we saw him coming from town with a magazine in his hand
167,the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know the longer he would stand hugging the lightpole on the corner the more he would wonder
47,wonder what he does in there he would murmur
49,looks like hed just stick his head out the door
58, jem said he goes out all right when its pitch dark
157,miss stephanie crawford said she woke up in the middle of the night one time and saw him looking straight through the window at her
47,said his head was like a skull lookin at her
61,aint you ever waked up at night and heard him dill
57,he walks like this jem slid his feet through the gravel
59,why do you think miss rachel locks up so tight at night
162,ive seen his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching on the back screen but he was gone time atticus got there
28, wonder what he looks like
282,jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch thats why his hands were bloodstained  if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off
159,there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time
40,lets try to make him come out said dill
33,id like to see what he looks like
104, jem said if dill wanted to get himself killed all he had to do was go up and knock on the front door
154,our first raid came to pass only because dill bet jem the gray ghost against two tom swifts that jem wouldnt get any farther than the radley gate
50,in all his life jem had never declined a dare
38,jem thought about it for three days
120,i suppose he loved honor more than his head for dill wore him down easily youre scared dill said the first day
36,aint scared just respectful jem said
95,the next day dill said youre too scared even to put your big toe in the front yard
95, jem said he reckoned he wasnt hed passed the radley place every school day of his life
21,always runnin i said
200,but dill got him the third day when he told jem that folks in meridian certainly werent as afraid as the folks in maycomb that hed never seen such scary folks as the ones in maycomb
169,this was enough to make jem march to the corner where he stopped and leaned against the lightpole watching the gate hanging crazily on its homemade hinge
134,i hope youve got it through your head that hell kill us each and every one dill harris said jem when we joined him
47,dont blame me when he gouges your eyes out
24,you started it remember
45, youre still scared murmured dill patiently
164,jem wanted dill to know once and for all that he wasnt scared of anything its just that i cant think of a way to make him come out without him gettin us
48, besides jem had his little sister to think of
43,when he said that i knew he was afraid
142,jem had his little sister to think of the time i dared him to jump off the top of the house if i got killed whatd become of you
117,then he jumped landed unhurt and his sense of responsibility left him until confronted by the radley place
31,you gonna run out on a dare
12, asked dill
71,if you are then dill you have to think about these things jem said
21,lemme think a minute
44,its sort of like making a turtle come out
10, asked dill
26,strike a match under him
84, i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him
58,dill said striking a match under a turtle was hateful
102,aint hateful just persuades him  s not like youd chunk him in the fire jem growled
41,how do you know a match dont hurt him
36, turtles cant feel stupid said jem
29,were you ever a turtle huh
12, my stars dill
17,now lemme think
21,reckon we can rock him
180, jem stood in thought so long that dill made a mild concession i wont say you ran out on a dare an ill swap you the gray ghost if you just go up and touch the house
14, jem brightened
27,touch the house that all
11, dill nodded
19,sure thats all now
75,i dont want you hollerin something different the minute i get back
24, yeah thats all said dill
169,hell probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we aint gonna hurt him
119, we left the corner crossed the side street that ran in front of the radley house and stopped at the gate
55,well go on said dill scout and mes right behind you
38, im going said jem dont hurry me
188, he walked to the corner of the lot then back again studying the simple terrain as if deciding how best to effect an entry frowning and scratching his head
21,then i sneered at him
172,jem threw open the gate and sped to the side of the house slapped it with his palm and ran back past us not waiting to see if his foray was successful
35,dill and i followed on his heels
64,safely on our porch panting and out of breath we looked back
122,the old house was the same droopy and sick but as we stared down the street we thought we saw an inside shutter move
57,a tiny almost invisible movement and the house was still
86,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  dill left us early in september to return to meridian
150,we saw him off on the five oclock bus and i was miserable without him until it occurred to me that i would be starting to school in a week
50,i never looked forward more to anything in my life
344,hours of wintertime had found me in the treehouse looking over at the schoolyard spying on multitudes of children through a twopower telescope jem had given me learning their games following jems red jacket through wriggling circles of blind mans buff secretly sharing their misfortunes and minor victories
21,i longed to join them
173,jem condescended to take me to school the first day a job usually done by ones parents but atticus had said jem would be delighted to show me where my room was
182,i think some money changed hands in this transaction for as we trotted around the corner past the radley place i heard an unfamiliar jingle in jems pockets
333,when we slowed to a walk at the edge of the schoolyard jem was careful to explain that during school hours i was not to bother him i was not to approach him with requests to enact a chapter of tarzan and the ant men to embarrass him with references to his private life or tag along behind him at recess and noon
75,i was to stick with the first grade and he would stick with the fifth
34,in short i was to leave him alone
29,you mean we cant play any more
80,well do like we always do at home he said but youll see  schools different
18, it certainly was
213,before the first morning was over miss caroline fisher our teacher hauled me up to the front of the room and patted the palm of my hand with a ruler then made me stand in the corner until noon
46,miss caroline was no more than twentyone
78,she had bright auburn hair pink cheeks and wore crimson fingernail polish
66,she also wore highheeled pumps and a red and whitestriped dress
49,she looked and smelled like a peppermint drop
186,she boarded across the street one door down from us in miss maudie atkinsons upstairs front room and when miss maudie introduced us to her jem was in a haze for days
101,miss caroline printed her name on the blackboard and said this says i am miss caroline fisher
46,i am from north alabama from winston county
139, the class murmured apprehensively should she prove to harbor her share of the peculiarities indigenous to that region
144,when alabama seceded from the union on january   winston county seceded from alabama and every child in maycomb county knew it
146, north alabama was full of liquor interests big mules steel companies republicans professors and other persons of no background
69,miss caroline began the day by reading us a story about cats
150,the cats had long conversations with one another they wore cunning little clothes and lived in a warm house beneath a kitchen stove
153,by the time mrs cat called the drugstore for an order of chocolate malted mice the class was wriggling like a bucketful of catawba worms
227,miss caroline seemed unaware that the ragged denimshirted and floursackskirted first grade most of whom had chopped cotton and fed hogs from the time they were able to walk were immune to imaginative literature
80,miss caroline came to the end of the story and said oh my wasnt that nice
164, then she went to the blackboard and printed the alphabet in enormous square capitals turned to the class and asked does anybody know what these are
75, everybody did most of the first grade had failed it last year
358,i suppose she chose me because she knew my name as i read the alphabet a faint line appeared between her eyebrows and after making me read most of my first reader and the stockmarket quotations from the mobile register aloud she discovered that i was literate and looked at me with more than faint distaste
103,miss caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more it would interfere with my reading
20, i said in surprise
43,he hasnt taught me anything miss caroline
108,atticus aint got time to teach me anything i added when miss caroline smiled and shook her head
66,why hes so tired at night he just sits in the livingroom and reads
32, if he didnt teach you who did
36, miss caroline asked goodnaturedly
12,somebody did
52,you werent born reading the mobile register
15, jem says i was
66,he read in a book where i was a bullfinch instead of a finch
162,jem says my names really jean louise bullfinch that i got swapped when i was born and im really a miss caroline apparently thought i was lying
66,lets not let our imaginations run away with us dear she said
53,now you tell your father not to teach you any more
46,its best to begin reading with a fresh mind
72,you tell him ill take over from here and try to undo the damage maam
38, your father does not know how to teach
23,you can have a seat now
67, i mumbled that i was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime
118,i never deliberately learned to read but somehow i had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers
59,in the long hours of church  was it then i learned
49,i could not remember not being able to read hymns
236,now that i was compelled to think about it reading was something that just came to me as learning to fasten the seat of my union suit without looking around or achieving two bows from a snarl of shoelaces
349,i could not remember when the lines above atticuss moving finger separated into words but i had stared at them all the evenings in my memory listening to the news of the day bills to be enacted into laws the diaries of lorenzo dow  anything atticus happened to be reading when i crawled into his lap every night
57,until i feared i would lose it i never loved to read
27,one does not love breathing
183,i knew i had annoyed miss caroline so i let well enough alone and stared out the window until recess when jem cut me from the covey of firstgraders in the schoolyard
37,he asked how i was getting along
33,if i didnt have to stay id leave
123,jem that damn lady says atticuss been teaching me to read and for him to stop it dont worry scout jem comforted me
68,our teacher says miss carolines introducing a new way of teaching
32,she learned about it in college
33,itll be in all the grades soon
119,you dont have to learn much out of books that way  its like if you wanta learn about cows you go milk one see
60, yeah jem but i dont wanta study cows i sure you do
76,you hafta know about cows theyre a big part of life in maycomb county
58, i contented myself with asking jem if hed lost his mind
83,im just trying to tell you the new way theyre teachin the first grade stubborn
27,its the dewey decimal system
81, having never questioned jems pronouncements i saw no reason to begin now
141,the dewey decimal system consisted in part of miss caroline waving cards at us on which were printed the cat rat man and you
114, no comment seemed to be expected of us and the class received these impressionistic revelations in silence
40,i was bored so i began a letter to dill
85,miss caroline caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me
17,besides she said
44,we dont write in the first grade we print
57,you wont learn to write until youre in the third grade
34, calpurnia was to blame for this
56,it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days i guess
146,she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the top of a tablet then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath
125,if i reproduced her penmanship satisfactorily she rewarded me with an openfaced sandwich of bread and butter and sugar
112,in calpurnia s teaching there was no sentimentality i seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me
127,everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands said miss caroline breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia
51,the town children did so and she looked us over
59,everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk
91, molasses buckets appeared from nowhere and the ceiling danced with metallic light
163,miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch containers nodding if the contents pleased her frowning a little at others
42,she stopped at walter cunninghams desk
13,wheres yours
81,walter cunninghams face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms
46,his absence of shoes told us how he got them
78,people caught hookworms going barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows
125,if walter had owned any shoes he would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid winter
61,he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls
40,did you forget your lunch this morning
20, asked miss caroline
30,walter looked straight ahead
39,i saw a muscle jump in his skinny jaw
31,did you forget it this morning
21, asked miss caroline
29,walters jaw twitched again
24,yebm he finally mumbled
52,miss caroline went to her desk and opened her purse
37,heres a quarter she said to walter
25,go and eat downtown today
29,you can pay me back tomorrow
21, walter shook his head
39,nome thank you maam he drawled softly
70,impatience crept into miss carolines voice here walter come get it
31, walter shook his head again
86,when walter shook his head a third time someone whispered go on and tell her scout
99, i turned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation looking at me
158,miss caroline and i had conferred twice already and they were looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding
58,i rose graciously on walters behalf ah  miss caroline
24, what is it jean louise
31, miss caroline hes a cunningham
17, i sat back down
17,what jean louise
53, i thought i had made things sufficiently clear
101,it was clear enough to the rest of us walter cunningham was sitting there lying his head off
46,he didnt forget his lunch he didnt have any
66,he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or the next day
84,he had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time in his life
62,i tried again walters one of the cunninghams miss caroline
34, i beg your pardon jean louise
75, thats okay maam youll get to know all the county folks after a while
98,the cunninghams never took anything they cant pay back  no church baskets and no scrip stamps
76,they never took anything off of anybody they get along on what they have
44,they dont have much but they get along on it
123, my special knowledge of the cunningham tribe  one branch that is  was gained from events of last winter
45,walters father was one of atticuss clients
180,after a dreary conversation in our livingroom one night about his entailment before mr cunningham left he said mr finch i dont know when ill ever be able to pay you
66, let that be the least of your worries walter atticus said
179,when i asked jem what entailment was and jem described it as a condition of having your tail in a crack i asked atticus if mr cunningham would ever pay us
79,not in money atticus said but before the years out ill have been paid
11, we watched
71,one morning jem and i found a load of stovewood in the back yard
57,later a sack of hickory nuts appeared on the back steps
49,with christmas came a crate of smilax and holly
109,that spring when we found a crokersack full of turnip greens atticus said mr cunningham had more than paid him
34,why does he pay you like that
42,because thats the only way he can pay me
15,he has no money
22, are we poor atticus
15, atticus nodded
12,we are indeed
19, jems nose wrinkled
32,are we as poor as the cunninghams
12, not exactly
80,the cunninghams are country folks farmers and the crash hit them hardest
79, atticus said professional people were poor because the farmers were poor
116,as maycomb county was farm country nickels and dimes were hard to come by for doctors and dentists and lawyers
65,entailment was only a part of mr cunninghams vexations
111,the acres not entailed were mortgaged to the hilt and the little cash he made went to interest
194,if he held his mouth right mr cunningham could get a wpa job but his land would go to ruin if he left it and he was willing to go hungry to keep his land and vote as he pleased
59,mr cunningham said atticus came from a set breed of men
99,as the cunninghams had no money to pay a lawyer they simply paid us with what they had
69,did you know said atticus that dr reynolds works the same way
69,he charges some folks a bushel of potatoes for delivery of a baby
79,miss scout if you give me your attention ill tell you what entailment is
54,jems definitions are very nearly accurate sometimes
276, if i could have explained these things to miss caroline i would have saved myself some inconvenience and miss caroline subsequent mortification but it was beyond my ability to explain things as well as atticus so i said youre shamin him miss caroline
86,walter hasnt got a quarter at home to bring you and you cant use any stovewood
109, miss caroline stood stock still then grabbed me by the collar and hauled me back to her desk
66,jean louise ive had about enough of you this morning she said
61,youre starting off on the wrong foot in every way my dear
18,hold out your hand
184, i thought she was going to spit in it which was the only reason anybody in maycomb held out his hand it was a timehonored method of sealing oral contracts
134,wondering what bargain we had made i turned to the class for an answer but the class looked back at me in puzzlement
121,miss caroline picked up her ruler gave me half a dozen quick little pats then told me to stand in the corner
117,a storm of laughter broke loose when it finally occurred to the class that miss caroline had whipped me
163,when miss caroline threatened it with a similar fate the first grade exploded again becoming cold sober only when the shadow of miss blount fell over them
226,miss blount a native maycombian as yet uninitiated in the mysteries of the decimal system appeared at the door hands on hips and announced if i hear another sound from this room ill burn up everybody in it
92,miss caroline the sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket
39, my sojourn in the corner was a short one
77,saved by the bell miss caroline watched the class file out for lunch
101,as i was the last to leave i saw her sink down into her chair and bury her head in her arms
86,had her conduct been more friendly toward me i would have felt sorry for her
34,she was a pretty little thing
191,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure but when i was rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop
29,youre biggern he is he said
32,hes as old as you nearly i said
42,he made me start off on the wrong foot
18, let him go scout
96, he didnt have any lunch i said and explained my involvement in walters dietary affairs
84,walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to jem and me
78,his fists were half cocked as if expecting an onslaught from both of us
81,i stomped at him to chase him away but jem put out his hand and stopped me
48,he examined walter with an air of speculation
50,your daddy mr walter cunningham from old sarum
29, he asked and walter nodded
114,walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food his eyes as blue as dill harriss were redrimmed and watery
88,there was no color in his face except at the tip of his nose which was moistly pink
82,he fingered the straps of his overalls nervously picking at the metal hooks
27,jem suddenly grinned at him
47,come on home to dinner with us walter he said
24,wed be glad to have you
39, walters face brightened then darkened
47,jem said our daddys a friend of your daddys
56,scout here shes crazy  she wont fight you any more
44, i wouldnt be too certain of that i said
100,jems free dispensation of my pledge irked me but precious noontime minutes were ticking away
36,yeah walter i wont jump on you again
28,dont you like butterbeans
26,our cals a real good cook
45, walter stood where he was biting his lip
102,jem and i gave up and we were nearly to the radley place when walter called hey im comin 
80, when walter caught up with us jem made pleasant conversation with him
76,a haint lives there he said cordially pointing to the radley house
29,ever hear about him walter
29, reckon i have said walter
157,almost died first year i come to school and et them pecans  folks say he pizened em and put em over on the school side of the fence
89, jem seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside him
94,indeed jem grew boastful i went all the way up to the house once he said to walter
126,anybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he passes it i said to the clouds above
28,and whos runnin miss priss
41, you are when aint anybody with you
87, by the time we reached our front steps walter had forgotten he was a cunningham
92,jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate we had company
92,atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crops neither jem nor i could follow
184,reason i cant pass the first grade mr finch is ive had to stay out ever spring an help papa with the choppin but theres anothern at the house now thats field size
46, did you pay a bushel of potatoes for him
42, i asked but atticus shook his head at me
129,while walter piled food on his plate he and atticus talked together like two men to the wonderment of jem and me
119,atticus was expounding upon farm problems when walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house
68,atticus summoned calpurnia who returned bearing the syrup pitcher
57,she stood waiting for walter to help himself
72,walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a generous hand
105,he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not asked what the sam hill he was doing
108,the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher and he quickly put his hands in his lap
24,then he ducked his head
35,atticus shook his head at me again
63,but hes gone and drowned his dinner in syrup i protested
94,hes poured it all over it was then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen
87,she was furious and when she was furious calpurnia s grammar became erratic
77,when in tranquility her grammar was as good as anybodys in maycomb
69,atticus said calpurnia had more education than most colored folks
74,when she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened
149,theres some folks who dont eat like us she whispered fiercely but you aint called on to contradict em at the table when they dont
87,that boys yo compny and if he wants to eat up the table cloth you let him you hear
64, he aint company cal hes just a cunningham hush your mouth
167,dont matter who they are anybody sets foot in this houses yo compny and dont you let me catch you remarkin on their ways like you was so high and mighty
204,yo folks might be bettern the cunninghams but it dont count for nothin the way youre disgracin em  if you cant act fit to eat at the table you can just set here and eat in the kitchen
90, calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging smack
159,i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen thankful though that i was spared the humiliation of facing them again
160,i told calpurnia to just wait id fix her one of these days when she wasnt looking id go off and drown myself in barkers eddy and then shed be sorry
127,besides i added shed already gotten me in trouble once today she had taught me to write and it was all her fault
27,hush your fussin she said
170,jem and walter returned to school ahead of me staying behind to advise atticus of calpurnias iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the radley place
127,she likes jem bettern she likes me anyway i concluded and suggested that atticus lose no time in packing her off
70,have you ever considered that jem doesnt worry her half as much
26, atticuss voice was flinty
53,ive no intention of getting rid of her now or ever
77,we couldnt operate a single day without cal have you ever thought of that
72,you think about how much cal does for you and you mind her you hear
107, i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered my resentments
104,i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the room sheer horror flooding her face
73,apparently she had revived enough to persevere in her profession
13, she screamed
74,the male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance
44,lord i thought shes scared of a mouse
120,little chuck little whose patience with all living things was phenomenal said which way did he go miss caroline
27,tell us where he went quick
73,dc he turned to a boy behind him  dc shut the door and well catch him
23,quick maam whered he go
125, miss caroline pointed a shaking finger not at the floor nor at a desk but to a hulking individual unknown to me
69,little chucks face contracted and he said gently you mean him maam
15,yessum hes alive
24,did he scare you some way
102, miss caroline said desperately i was just walking by when it crawled out of his hair
61,just crawled out of his hair little chuck grinned broadly
41,there aint no need to fear a cootie maam
22,aint you ever seen one
82,now dont you be afraid you just go back to your desk and teach us some more
156, little chuck little was another member of the population who didnt know where his next meal was coming from but he was a born gentleman
82,he put his hand under her elbow and led miss caroline to the front of the room
33,now dont you fret maam he said
40,there aint no need to fear a cootie
36,ill just fetch you some cool water
83, the cooties host showed not the faintest interest in the furor he had wrought
121,he searched the scalp above his forehead located his guest and pinched it between his thumb and forefinger
60,miss caroline watched the process in horrid fascination
78,little chuck brought water in a paper cup and she drank it gratefully
25,finally she found her voice
22,what is your name son
18, she asked softly
14,the boy blinked
21, miss caroline nodded
13,burris ewell
36, miss caroline inspected her rollbook
51,i have a ewell here but i dont have a first name
41,would you spell your first name for me
15, dont know how
25,they call me burrist home
95, well burris said miss caroline i think wed better excuse you for the rest of the afternoon
43,i want you to go home and wash your hair
101, from her desk she produced a thick volume leafed through its pages and read for a moment
94,a good home remedy for  burris i want you to go home and wash your hair with lye soap
55,when youve done that treat your scalp with kerosene
18, what fer missus
29, to get rid of the  er cooties
93,you see burris the other children might catch them and you wouldnt want that would you
17, the boy stood up
43,he was the filthiest human i had ever seen
120,his neck was dark gray the backs of his hands were rusty and his fingernails were black deep into the quick
70,he peered at miss caroline from a fistsized clean space on his face
118,no one had noticed him probably because miss caroline and i had entertained the class most of the morning
96,and burris said miss caroline please bathe yourself before you come back tomorrow
23, the boy laughed rudely
31,you aint sendin me home missus
67,i was on the verge of leavin  i done done my time for this year
31, miss caroline looked puzzled
26,what do you mean by that
24, the boy did not answer
37,he gave a short contemptuous snort
169,one of the elderly members of the class answered her hes one of the ewells maam and i wondered if this explanation would be as unsuccessful as my attempt
46,but miss caroline seemed willing to listen
23,whole schools full of em
47,they come first day every year and then leave
107,the truant lady gets em here cause she threatens em with the sheriff but shes give up tryin to hold em
121,she reckons shes carried out the law just gettin their names on the roll and runnin em here the first day
54,youre supposed to mark em absent the rest of the year
34, but what about their parents
41, asked miss caroline in genuine concern
71,aint got no mother was the answer and their paws right contentious
52, burris ewell was flattered by the recital
94,been comin to the first day o the first grade fer three year now he said expansively
64,reckon if im smart this year theyll promote me to the second
131, miss caroline said sit back down please burris and the moment she said it i knew she had made a serious mistake
40,the boys condescension flashed to anger
27,you try and make me missus
38, little chuck little got to his feet
23,let him go maam he said
37,hes a mean one a harddown mean one
64,hes liable to start somethin and theres some little folks here
145, he was among the most diminutive of men but when burris ewell turned toward him little chucks right hand went to his pocket
34,watch your step burris he said
35,id soons kill you as look at you
12,now go home
146, burris seemed to be afraid of a child half his height and miss caroline took advantage of his indecision burris go home
46,if you dont ill call the principal she said
33,ill have to report this anyway
52, the boy snorted and slouched leisurely to the door
71,safely out of range he turned and shouted report and be damned to ye
83,aint no snotnosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born cn make me do nothin
38,you aint makin me go nowhere missus
58,you just remember that you aint makin me go nowhere
87, he waited until he was sure she was crying then he shuffled out of the building
91,soon we were clustered around her desk trying in our various ways to comfort her
25,he was a real mean one
15,below the belt
45,you aint called on to teach folks like that
48,them aint maycombs ways miss caroline not really
23,now dont you fret maam
42,miss caroline why dont you read us a story
46,that cat thing was real fine this mornin 
194,miss caroline smiled blew her nose said thank you darlings dispersed us opened a book and mystified the first grade with a long narrative about a toadfrog that lived in a hall
137,when i passed the radley place for the fourth time that day  twice at a full gallop  my gloom had deepened to match the house
246,if the remainder of the school year were as fraught with drama as the first day perhaps it would be mildly entertaining but the prospect of spending nine months refraining from reading and writing made me think of running away
196,by late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete when jem and i raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work i didnt give him much of a race
120,it was our habit to run meet atticus the moment we saw him round the post office corner in the distance
113,atticus seemed to have forgotten my noontime fall from grace he was full of questions about school
57,my replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me
93,perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one she let me watch her fix supper
79,shut your eyes and open your mouth and ill give you a surprise she said
161,it was not often that she made crackling bread she said she never had time but with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her
37,she knew i loved crackling bread
30,i missed you today she said
83,the house got so lonesome long about two oclock i had to turn on the radio
54,jemn me aint ever in the house unless its rainin
65, i know she said but one of yous always in callin distance
63,i wonder how much of the day i spend just callin after you
111,well she said getting up from the kitchen chair its enough time to make a pan of cracklin bread i reckon
59,you run along now and let me get supper on the table
35, calpurnia bent down and kissed me
49,i ran along wondering what had come over her
50,she had wanted to make up with me that was it
139,she had always been too hard on me she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways she was sorry and too stubborn to say so
34,i was weary from the days crimes
87,after supper atticus sat down with the paper and called scout ready to read
78, the lord sent me more than i could bear and i went to the front porch
19,atticus followed me
23,something wrong scout
125, i told atticus i didnt feel very well and didnt think id go to school any more if it was all right with him
56,atticus sat down in the swing and crossed his legs
102,his fingers wandered to his watchpocket he said that was the only way he could think
149,he waited in amiable silence and i sought to reinforce my position you never went to school and you do all right so ill just stay home too
60,you can teach me like granddaddy taught you n uncle jack
26, no i cant said atticus
21,i have to make a living
111,besides theyd put me in jail if i kept you at home  dose of magnesia for you tonight and school tomorrow
29, im feeling all right really
11, thought so
23,now whats the matter
124, bit by bit i told him the days misfortunes and she said you taught me all wrong so we cant ever read any more ever
35,please dont send me back please sir
58, atticus stood up and walked to the end of the porch
84,when he completed his examination of the wisteria vine he strolled back to me
126,first of all he said if you can learn a simple trick scout youll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks
94,you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view sir
57, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it
112, atticus said i had learned many things today and miss caroline had learned several things herself
202,she had learned not to hand something to a cunningham for one thing but if walter and i had put ourselves in her shoes wed have seen it was an honest mistake on her part
135,we could not expect her to learn all maycombs ways in one day and we could not hold her responsible when she knew no better
19,ill be dogged i said
127,i didnt know no better than not to read to her and she held me responsible  listen atticus i dont have to go to school
36, i was bursting with a sudden thought
21,burris ewell remember
35,he just goes to school the first day
138,the truant lady reckons shes carried out the law when she gets his name on the roll you cant do that scout atticus said
67,sometimes its better to bend the law a little in special cases
44,in your case the law remains rigid
23,so to school you must go
42, i dont see why i have to when he doesnt
10, then listen
90, atticus said the ewells had been the disgrace of maycomb for three generations
66,none of them had done an honest days work in his recollection
148,he said that some christmas when he was getting rid of the tree he would take me with him and show me where and how they lived
47,they were people but they lived like animals
124,they can go to school any time they want to when they show the faintest symptom of wanting an education said atticus
187,there are ways of keeping them in school by force but its silly to force people like the ewells into a new environment if i didnt go to school tomorrow youd force me to
46, let us leave it at this said atticus dryly
45,you miss scout finch are of the common folk
22,you must obey the law
82, he said that the ewells were members of an exclusive society made up of ewells
175,in certain circumstances the common folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of becoming blind to some of the ewells activities
51,they didnt have to go to school for one thing
94,another thing mr bob ewell burriss father was permitted to hunt and trap out of season
23,atticus thats bad i said
121,in maycomb county hunting out of season was a misdemeanor at law a capital felony in the eyes of the populace
208,its against the law all right said my father and its certainly bad but when a man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying from hunger pains
106,i dont know of any landowner around here who begrudges those children any game their father can hit
89, mr ewell shouldnt do that of course he shouldnt but hell never change his ways
60,are you going to take out your disapproval on his children
119, no sir i murmured and made a final stand but if i keep on goin to school we cant ever read any more
38, thats really bothering you isnt it
112, when atticus looked down at me i saw the expression on his face that always made me expect something
34,do you know what a compromise is
16,bending the law
49, no an agreement reached by mutual concessions
27,it works this way he said
112,if youll concede the necessity of going to school well go on reading every night just as we always have
16,is it a bargain
109, well consider it sealed without the usual formality atticus said when he saw me preparing to spit
129,as i opened the front screen door atticus said by the way scout youd better not say anything at school about our agreement
113, im afraid our activities would be received with considerable disapprobation by the more learned authorities
194, jem and i were accustomed to our fathers lastwillandtestament diction and we were at all times free to interrupt atticus for a translation when it was beyond our understanding
192, i never went to school he said but i have a feeling that if you tell miss caroline we read every night shell get after me and i wouldnt want her after me
251, atticus kept us in fits that evening gravely reading columns of print about a man who sat on a flagpole for no discernible reason which was reason enough for jem to spend the following saturday aloft in the treehouse
136,jem sat from after breakfast until sunset and would have remained overnight had not atticus severed his supply lines
272,i had spent most of the day climbing up and down running errands for him providing him with literature nourishment and water and was carrying him blankets for the night when atticus said if i paid no attention to him jem would come down
18,atticus was right
115,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  the remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first
259,indeed they were an endless project that slowly evolved into a unit in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the state of alabama in its wellmeaning but fruitless efforts to teach me group dynamics
165,what jem called the dewey decimal system was schoolwide by the end of my first year so i had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques
145,i could only look around me atticus and my uncle who went to school at home knew everything  at least what one didnt know the other did
248,furthermore i couldnt help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature elected each time without opposition innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of good citizenship
233,jem educated on a halfdecimal half duncecap basis seemed to function effectively alone or in a group but jem was a poor example no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books
324,as for me i knew nothing except what i gathered from time magazine and reading everything i could lay hands on at home but as i inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the maycomb county school system i could not help receiving the impression that i was being cheated out of something
146,out of what i knew not yet i did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me
222,as the year passed released from school thirty minutes before jem who had to stay until three oclock i ran by the radley place as fast as i could not stopping until i reached the safety of our front porch
156,one afternoon as i raced by something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that i took a deep breath a long look around and went back
119,two live oaks stood at the edge of the radley lot their roots reached out into the sideroad and made it bumpy
64,something about one of the trees attracted my attention
108,some tinfoil was sticking in a knothole just above my eye level winking at me in the afternoon sun
149,i stood on tiptoe hastily looked around once more reached into the hole and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers
109,my first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible but i remembered where i was
60,i ran home and on our front porch i examined my loot
20,the gum looked fresh
43,i sniffed it and it smelled all right
33,i licked it and waited for a while
72,when i did not die i crammed it into my mouth wrigleys double mint
57,when jem came home he asked me where i got such a wad
23,i told him i found it
30,dont eat things you find scout
47, this wasnt on the ground it was in a tree
12, jem growled
18,well it was i said
66,it was sticking in that tree yonder the one comin from school
22, spit it out right now
15, i spat it out
27,the tang was fading anyway
73,ive been chewin it all afternoon and i aint dead yet not even sick
20, jem stamped his foot
77,dont you know youre not supposed to even touch the trees over there
28,youll get killed if you do
32, you touched the house once
21, that was different
37,you go gargle  right now you hear me
49, aint neither itll take the taste outa my mouth
38, you dont n ill tell calpurnia on you
65, rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia i did as jem told me
222,for some reason my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship calpurnias tyranny unfairness and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval
68,on my part i went to much trouble sometimes not to provoke her
55,summer was on the way jem and i awaited it with impatience
264,summer was our best season it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots or trying to sleep in the treehouse summer was everything good to eat it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape but most of all summer was dill
102,the authorities released us early the last day of school and jem and i walked home together
52,reckon old dillll be coming home tomorrow i said
27,probably day after said jem
38,missippi turns em loose a day later
282, as we came to the live oaks at the radley place i raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knothole where i had found the chewing gum trying to make jem believe i had found it there and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil
14,i see it scout
86,i see it jem looked around reached up and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package
139,we ran home and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewinggum wrappers
86,it was the kind of box wedding rings came in purple velvet with a minute catch
34,jem flicked open the tiny catch
74,inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies one on top of the other
18,jem examined them
18,indianheads he said
51,nineteensix and scout one of ems nineteenhundred
20,these are real old
26, nineteenhundred i echoed
31,say hush a minute im thinkin
45, jem you reckon thats somebodys hidin place
117, naw dont anybody much but us pass by there unless its some grown persons grown folks dont have hidin places
36,you reckon we ought to keep em jem
41, i dont know what we could do scout
25,whod we give em back to
130,i know for a fact dont anybody go by there  cecil goes by the back street an all the way around by town to get home
208, cecil jacobs who lived at the far end of our street next door to the post office walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the radley place and old mrs henry lafayette dubose
152,mrs dubose lived two doors up the street from us neighborhood opinion was unanimous that mrs dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived
60,jem wouldnt go by her place without atticus beside him
31,what you reckon we oughta do jem
49, finders were keepers unless title was proven
232,plucking an occasional camellia getting a squirt of hot milk from miss maudie atkinsons cow on a summer day helping ourselves to someones scuppernongs was part of our ethical culture but money was different
25,tell you what said jem
92,well keep em till school starts then go around and ask everybody if theyre theirs
101,theyre some bus childs maybe  he was too taken up with gettin outa school today an forgot em
31,these are somebodys i know that
31,see how theyve been slicked up
17,theyve been saved
74, yeah but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that
22,you know it doesnt last
19, i dont know scout
35,but these are important to somebody
14, hows that jem
59, well indianheads  well they come from the indians
56,theyre real strong magic they make you have good luck
129,not like fried chicken when youre not lookin for it but things like long life n good health n passin sixweeks tests
36,these are real valuable to somebody
29,im gonna put em in my trunk
81, before jem went to his room he looked for a long time at the radley place
30,he seemed to be thinking again
444,two days later dill arrived in a blaze of glory he had ridden the train by himself from meridian to maycomb junction a courtesy title  maycomb junction was in abbott county where he had been met by miss rachel in maycomb s one taxi he had eaten dinner in the diner he had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in bay st louis and stuck to his story regardless of threats
231,he had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt he was somewhat heavier no taller and said he had seen his father
123,dills father was taller than ours he had a black beard pointed and was president of the l amp n railroad
55,i helped the engineer for a while said dill yawning
28,in a pigs ear you did dill
14,hush said jem
20,whatll we play today
33, tom and sam and dick said dill
27,lets go in the front yard
75, dill wanted the rover boys because there were three respectable parts
49,he was clearly tired of being our character man
26,im tired of those i said
184,i was tired of playing tom rover who suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of the script until the end when he was found in alaska
25,make us up one jem i said
25,im tired of makin em up
46, our first days of freedom and we were tired
37,i wondered what the summer would bring
142,we had strolled to the front yard where dill stood looking down the street at the dreary face of the radley place
27,i  smell  death he said
51,i do i mean it he said when i told him to shut up
51,you mean when somebodys dyin you can smell it
64, no i mean i can smell somebody an tell if theyre gonna die
25,an old lady taught me how
33, dill leaned over and sniffed me
58,jean  louise  finch you are going to die in three days
49, dill if you dont hush ill knock you bowlegged
79,i mean it now yawl hush growled jem you act like you believe in hot steams
30, you act like you dont i said
19,whats a hot steam
11, asked dill
84,havent you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by a hot place
15, jem asked dill
244,a hot steams somebody who cant get to heaven just wallows around on lonesome roads an if you walk through him when you die youll be one too an youll go around at night suckin peoples breath how can you keep from passing through one
18, you cant said jem
166,sometimes they stretch all the way across the road but if you hafta go through one you say angelbright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath
87, that keeps em from wrapping around you dont you believe a word he says dill i said
30,calpurnia says thats nigger talk
88, jem scowled darkly at me but said well are we gonna play anything or not
36, lets roll in the tire i suggested
20,you know im too big
12, you cn push
78, i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house
34,i slapped it up to the front yard
15,im first i said
53,dill said he ought to be first he just got here
118,jem arbitrated awarded me first push with an extra time for dill and i folded myself inside the tire
176,until it happened i did not realize that jem was offended by my contradicting him on hot steams and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me
78,he did by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body
92,ground sky and houses melted into a mad palette my ears throbbed i was suffocating
89,i could not put out my hands to stop they were wedged between my chest and knees
118,i could only hope that jem would outrun the tire and me or that i would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk
47,i heard him behind me chasing and shouting
130,the tire bumped on gravel skeetered across the road crashed into a barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement
161,dizzy and nauseated i lay on the cement and shook my head still pounded my ears to silence and heard jems voice scout get away from there come on
77, i raised my head and stared at the radley place steps in front of me
35,come on scout dont just lie there
19, jem was screaming
14,get up cantcha
44, i got to my feet trembling as i thawed
12,get the tire
13, jem hollered
17,bring it with you
30,aint you got any sense at all
99, when i was able to navigate i ran back to them as fast as my shaking knees would carry me
24,why didnt you bring it
11, jem yelled
20,why dont you get it
11, i screamed
13,jem was silent
32,go on it aint far inside the gate
47,why you even touched the house once remember
145, jem looked at me furiously could not decline ran down the sidewalk treaded water at the gate then dashed in and retrieved the tire
31, jem was scowling triumphantly
11,nothin to it
76,i swear scout sometimes you act so much like a girl its mortifyin
73, there was more to it than he knew but i decided not to tell him
66,calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled lemonade time
52,you all get in outa that hot sun fore you fry alive
66, lemonade in the middle of the morning was a summertime ritual
88,calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch then went about her business
63,being out of jems good graces did not worry me especially
39,lemonade would restore his good humor
61,jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest
50,i know what we are going to play he announced
36,something new something different
11, asked dill
201, jems head at times was transparent he had thought that up to make me understand he wasnt afraid of radleys in any shape or form to contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice
11, asked dill
56,jem said scout you can be mrs radley i declare if i will
19,i dont think  smarter
12,still scared
49, he can get out at night when were all asleep
39,scout hows he gonna know what were doin
38,besides i dont think hes still there
58,he died years ago and they stuffed him up the chimney
72, dill said jem you and me can play and scout can watch if shes scared
226, i was fairly sure boo radley was inside that house but i couldnt prove it and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or i would be accused of believing in hot steams phenomena i was immune to in the daytime
105,jem parceled out our roles i was mrs radley and all i had to do was come out and sweep the porch
102,dill was old mr radley he walked up and down the sidewalk and coughed when jem spoke to him
100,jem naturally was boo he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time to time
43,as the summer progressed so did our game
140,we polished and perfected it added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon which we rang changes every day
150,dill was a villains villain he could get into any character part assigned him and appear tall if height was part of the devilry required
78,he was as good as his worst performance his worst performance was gothic
59,i reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script
258,i never thought it as much fun as tarzan and i played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jems assurances that boo radley was dead and nothing would get me with him and calpurnia there in the daytime and atticus home at night
20,jem was a born hero
197,it was a melancholy little drama woven from bits and scraps of gossip and neighborhood legend mrs radley had been beautiful until she married mr radley and lost all her money
88,she also lost most of her teeth her hair and her right forefinger dills contribution
82,boo bit it off one night when he couldnt find any cats and squirrels to eat
130, she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time while boo slowly whittled away all the furniture in the house
204,the three of us were the boys who got into trouble i was the probate judge for a change dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the steps poking him with the brushbroom
184,jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff assorted townsfolk and miss stephanie crawford who had more to say about the radleys than anybody in maycomb
224,when it was time to play boos big scene jem would sneak into the house steal the scissors from the sewingmachine drawer when calpurnia s back was turned then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers
89,dill would walk by cough at jem and jem would fake a plunge into dills thigh
36,from where i stood it looked real
213,when mr nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town we would stand still and silent until he was out of sight then wonder what he would do to us if he suspected
188,our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared and once i saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us her hedge clippers poised in midair
205,one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv book ii of one mans family we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us slapping a rolled magazine against his knee
25,the sun said twelve noon
23,what are you all playing
17,nothing said jem
61,jems evasion told me our game was a secret so i kept quiet
45,what are you doing with those scissors then
40,why are you tearing up that newspaper
27,if its todays ill tan you
13, nothing what
13, said atticus
11,nothing sir
39, give me those scissors atticus said
29,theyre no things to play with
64,does this by any chance have anything to do with the radleys
26, no sir said jem reddening
60,i hope it doesnt he said shortly and went inside the house
11,jem shut up
52,hes gone in the livingroom he can hear us in there
63, safely in the yard dill asked jem if we could play any more
11,i dont know
76,atticus didnt say we couldnt jem i said i think atticus knows it anyway
10, no he dont
26,if he did hed say he did
229, i was not so sure but jem told me i was being a girl that girls always imagined things thats why other people hated them so and if i started behaving like one i could just go off and find some to play with
44,all right you just keep it up then i said
14,youll find out
72, atticus s arrival was the second reason i wanted to quit the game
75,the first reason happened the day i rolled into the radley front yard
155,through all the head shaking quelling of nausea and jemyelling i had heard another sound so low i could not have heard it from the sidewalk
37,someone inside the house was laughing
191,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  my nagging got the better of jem eventually as i knew it would and to my relief we slowed down the game for a while
289,he still maintained however that atticus hadnt said we couldnt therefore we could and if atticus ever said we couldnt jem had thought of a way around it he would simply change the names of the characters and then we couldnt be accused of playing anything
57,dill was in hearty agreement with this plan of action
69,dill was becoming something of a trial anyway following jem about
94,he had asked me earlier in the summer to marry him then he promptly forgot about it
112,he staked me out marked as his property said i was the only girl he would ever love then he neglected me
75,i beat him up twice but it did no good he only grew closer to jem
120,they spent days together in the treehouse plotting and planning calling me only when they needed a third party
230,but i kept aloof from their more foolhardy schemes for a while and on pain of being called a girl i spent most of the remaining twilights that summer sitting with miss maudie atkinson on her front porch
162,jem and i had always enjoyed the free run of miss maudies yard if we kept out of her azaleas but our contact with her was not clearly defined
140,until jem and dill excluded me from their plans she was only another lady in the neighborhood but a relatively benign presence
359,our tacit treaty with miss maudie was that we could play on her lawn eat her scuppernongs if we didnt jump on the arbor and explore her vast back lot terms so generous we seldom spoke to her so careful were we to preserve the delicate balance of our relationship but jem and dill drove me closer to her with their behavior
64,miss maudie hated her house time spent indoors was time wasted
232,she was a widow a chameleon lady who worked in her flower beds in an old straw hat and mens coveralls but after her five oclock bath she would appear on the porch and reign over the street in magisterial beauty
62,she loved everything that grew in gods earth even the weeds
18,with one exception
321,if she found a blade of nut grass in her yard it was like the second battle of the marne she swooped down upon it with a tin tub and subjected it to blasts from beneath with a poisonous substance she said was so powerful itd kill us all if we didnt stand out of the way
29,why cant you just pull it up
91, i asked after witnessing a prolonged campaign against a blade not three inches high
29,pull it up child pull it up
77, she picked up the limp sprout and squeezed her thumb up its tiny stalk
28,microscopic grains oozed out
48,why one sprig of nut grass can ruin a whole yard
85,when it comes fall this dries up and the wind blows it all over maycomb county
84, miss maudies face likened such an occurrence unto an old testament pestilence
58,her speech was crisp for a maycomb county inhabitant
126,she called us by all our names and when she grinned she revealed two minute gold prongs clipped to her eyeteeth
82,when i admired them and hoped i would have some eventually she said look here
123, with a click of her tongue she thrust out her bridgework a gesture of cordiality that cemented our friendship
191,miss maudies benevolence extended to jem and dill whenever they paused in their pursuits we reaped the benefits of a talent miss maudie had hitherto kept hidden from us
48,she made the best cakes in the neighborhood
218,when she was admitted into our confidence every time she baked she made a big cake and three little ones and she would call across the street jem finch scout finch charles baker harris come here
36, our promptness was always rewarded
48,in summertime twilights are long and peaceful
256,often as not miss maudie and i would sit silently on her porch watching the sky go from yellow to pink as the sun went down watching flights of martins sweep low over the neighborhood and disappear behind the schoolhouse rooftops
70,miss maudie i said one evening do you think boo radleys still alive
44, his names arthur and hes alive she said
44,she was rocking slowly in her big oak chair
23,do you smell my mimosa
38,its like angels breath this evening
15,how do you know
16, know what child
31, that b mr arthurs still alive
24, what a morbid question
35,but i suppose its a morbid subject
77,i know hes alive jean louise because i havent seen him carried out yet
55, maybe he died and they stuffed him up the chimney
36, where did you get such a notion
44, thats what jem said he thought they did
35,he gets more like jack finch every day
87, miss maudie had known uncle jack finch atticuss brother since they were children
75,nearly the same age they had grown up together at finchs landing
77,miss maudie was the daughter of a neighboring landowner dr frank buford
118,dr bufords profession was medicine and his obsession was anything that grew in the ground so he stayed poor
112,uncle jack finch confined his passion for digging to his window boxes in nashville and stayed rich
130,we saw uncle jack every christmas and every christmas he yelled across the street for miss maudie to come marry him
128,miss maudie would yell back call a little louder jack finch and theyll hear you at the post office i havent heard you yet
119, jem and i thought this a strange way to ask for a ladys hand in marriage but then uncle jack was rather strange
355,he said he was trying to get miss maudies goat that he had been trying unsuccessfully for forty years that he was the last person in the world miss maudie would think about marrying but the first person she thought about teasing and the best defense to her was spirited offense all of which we understood clearly
71,arthur radley just stays in the house thats all said miss maudie
60,wouldnt you stay in the house if you didnt want to come out
32, yessum but id wanta come out
13,why doesnt he
29, miss maudies eyes narrowed
37,you know that story as well as i do
27, i never heard why though
24,nobody ever told me why
36, miss maudie settled her bridgework
86,you know old mr radley was a foot washing baptist thats what you are aint it
30, my shells not that hard child
16,im just a baptist
38, dont you all believe in footwashing
26,at home in the bathtub
245, but we cant have communion with you all apparently deciding that it was easier to define primitive baptistry than closed communion miss maudie said footwashers believe anything thats pleasure is a sin
154,did you know some of em came out of the woods one saturday and passed by this place and told me me and my flowers were going to hell
18, your flowers too
25,theyd burn right with me
114,they thought i spent too much time in gods outdoors and not enough time inside the house reading the bible
126, my confidence in pulpit gospel lessened at the vision of miss maudie stewing forever in various protestant hells
148,true enough she had an acid tongue in her head and she did not go about the neighborhood doing good as did miss stephanie crawford
119,but while no one with a grain of sense trusted miss stephanie jem and i had considerable faith in miss maudie
120,she had never told on us had never played catandmouse with us she was not at all interested in our private lives
19,she was our friend
100,how so reasonable a creature could live in peril of everlasting torment was incomprehensible
27,that aint right miss maudie
30,youre the best lady i know
21, miss maudie grinned
12,thank you maam
60,thing is footwashers think women are a sin by definition
40,they take the bible literally you know
71, is that why mr arthur stays in the house to keep away from women
13, ive no idea
26, it doesnt make sense to me
89,looks like if mr arthur was hankerin after heaven hed come out on the porch at least
116,atticus says gods loving folks like you love yourself miss maudie stopped rocking and her voice hardened
175,you are too young to understand it she said but sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of  oh of your father
14, i was shocked
39,atticus doesnt drink whiskey i said
55,he never drunk a drop in his life  nome yes he did
51,he said he drank some one time and didnt like it
21, miss maudie laughed
37,wasnt talking about your father she said
125,what i meant was if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnt be as hard as some men are at their best
203,there are just some kind of men who  who re so busy worrying about the next world theyve never learned to live in this one and you can look down the street and see the results
71, do you think theyre true all those things they say about b  mr
11, what things
11, i told her
94,that is threefourths colored folks and onefourth stephanie crawford said miss maudie grimly
133,stephanie crawford even told me once she woke up in the middle of the night and found him looking in the window at her
80,i said what did you do stephanie move over in the bed and make room for him
27,that shut her up a while
22, i was sure it did
57,miss maudie s voice was enough to shut anybody up
40,no child she said that is a sad house
46,i remember arthur radley when he was a boy
70,he always spoke nicely to me no matter what folks said he did
30,spoke as nicely as he knew how
23, you reckon hes crazy
29, miss maudie shook her head
33,if hes not he should be by now
61,the things that happen to people we never really know
209,what happens in houses behind closed doors what secrets atticus dont ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he dont do in the yard i said feeling it my duty to defend my parent
198,gracious child i was raveling a thread wasnt even thinking about your father but now that i am ill say this atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on the public streets
47,howd you like some fresh poundcake to take home
21, i liked it very much
100,next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in conversation
45,when i joined them as usual they said go away
51,this yards as much mine as it is yours jem finch
56,i got just as much right to play in it as you have
110, dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle if you stay youve got to do what we tell you dill warned
49,we i said whos so high and mighty all of a sudden
95, if you dont say youll do what we tell you we aint gonna tell you anything dill continued
49,you act like you grew ten inches in the night
21,all right what is it
65, jem said placidly we are going to give a note to boo radley
65, i was trying to fight down the automatic terror rising in me
87,it was all right for miss maudie to talk  she was old and snug on her porch
25,it was different for us
110,jem was merely going to put the note on the end of a fishing pole and stick it through the shutters
54,if anyone came along dill would ring the bell
28,dill raised his right hand
42,in it was my mothers silver dinnerbell
56,im goin around to the side of the house said jem
74,we looked yesterday from across the street and theres a shutter loose
64,think maybe i can make it stick on the window sill at least
87, jem now youre in it and you cant get out of it youll just stay in it miss priss
35, okay okay but i dont wanta watch
182,jem somebody was yes you will youll watch the back end of the lot and dills gonna watch the front of the house an up the street an if anybody comes hell ring the bell
16, all right then
19,whatd you write him
168, dill said were askin him real politely to come out sometimes and tell us what he does in there  we said we wouldnt hurt him and wed buy him an ice cream
37, you allve gone crazy hell kill us
22, dill said its my idea
81,i figure if hed come out and sit a spell with us he might feel better
36, how do you know he dont feel good
97, well howd you feel if youd been shut up for a hundred years with nothin but cats to eat
56,i bet hes got a beard down to here like your daddys
69, he aint got a beard he dill stopped as if trying to remember
19,uh huh caughtcha i said
132,you said fore you were off the train good your daddy had a black beard if its all the same to you he shaved it off last summer
72,yeah an ive got the letter to prove it  he sent me two dollars too
68, keep on  i reckon he even sent you a mounted police uniform
26,thatn never showed up did it
90,you just keep on tellin em son dill harris could tell the biggest ones i ever heard
203,among other things he had been up in a mail plane seventeen times he had been to nova scotia he had seen an elephant and his granddaddy was brigadier general joe wheeler and left him his sword
22,you all hush said jem
76,he scuttled beneath the house and came out with a yellow bamboo pole
59,reckon this is long enough to reach from the sidewalk
104, anybody whos brave enough to go up and touch the house hadnt oughta use a fishin pole i said
46,why dont you just knock the front door down
75, this  is  different said jem how many times do i have to tell you that
69, dill took a piece of paper from his pocket and gave it to jem
65,the three of us walked cautiously toward the old house
164,dill remained at the lightpole on the front corner of the lot and jem and i edged down the sidewalk parallel to the side of the house
67,i walked beyond jem and stood where i could see around the curve
17,all clear i said
20,not a soul in sight
51, jem looked up the sidewalk to dill who nodded
156,jem attached the note to the end of the fishing pole let the pole out across the yard and pushed it toward the window he had selected
94,the pole lacked several inches of being long enough and jem leaned over as far as he could
94,i watched him making jabbing motions for so long i abandoned my post and went to him
85,cant get it off the pole he muttered or if i got it off i cant make it stay
33,gon back down the street scout
58, i returned and gazed around the curve at the empty road
111,occasionally i looked back at jem who was patiently trying to place the note on the window sill
146,it would flutter to the ground and jem would jab it up until i thought if boo radley ever received it he wouldnt be able to read it
59,i was looking down the street when the dinnerbell rang
146,shoulder up i reeled around to face boo radley and his bloody fangs instead i saw dill ringing the bell with all his might in atticuss face
73,jem looked so awful i didnt have the heart to tell him i told him so
73,he trudged along dragging the pole behind him on the sidewalk
37,atticus said stop ringing that bell
95, dill grabbed the clapper in the silence that followed i wished hed start ringing it again
91,atticus pushed his hat to the back of his head and put his hands on his hips
34,jem he said what were you doing
10, nothin sir
21, i dont want any of that
55, i was  we were just tryin to give somethin to mr
33, what were you trying to give him
14, just a letter
14, let me see it
38, jem held out a filthy piece of paper
39,atticus took it and tried to read it
35,why do you want mr radley to come out
53, dill said we thought he might enjoy us
43, and dried up when atticus looked at him
103,son he said to jem im going to tell you something and tell you one time stop tormenting that man
36,that goes for the other two of you
41, what mr radley did was his own business
33,if he wanted to come out he would
189,if he wanted to stay inside his own house he had the right to stay inside free from the attentions of inquisitive children which was a mild term for the likes of us
111,how would we like it if atticus barged in on us without knocking when we were in our rooms at night
55,we were in effect doing the same thing to mr radley
87,what mr radley did might seem peculiar to us but it did not seem peculiar to him
159,furthermore had it never occurred to us that the civil way to communicate with another being was by the front door instead of a side window
329,lastly we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there we were not to play an asinine game he had seen us playing or make fun of anybody on this street or in this town we werent makin fun of him we werent laughin at him said jem we were just so that was what you were doing wasnt it
18, makin fun of him
97, no said atticus putting his lifes history on display for the edification of the neighborhood
29, jem seemed to swell a little
46,i didnt say we were doin that i didnt say it
24, atticus grinned dryly
25,you just told me he said
51,you stop this nonsense right now every one of you
17, jem gaped at him
33,you want to be a lawyer dont you
89, our fathers mouth was suspiciously firm as if he were trying to hold it in line
62,jem decided there was no point in quibbling and was silent
199,when atticus went inside the house to retrieve a file he had forgotten to take to work that morning jem finally realized that he had been done in by the oldest lawyers trick on record
116,he waited a respectful distance from the front steps watched atticus leave the house and walk toward town
137,when atticus was out of earshot jem yelled after him i thought i wanted to be a lawyer but i aint so sure now
201,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  yes said our father when jem asked him if we could go over and sit by miss rachels fishpool with dill as this was his last night in maycomb
52,tell him so long for me and well see him next summer
84, we leaped over the low wall that separated miss rachels yard from our driveway
59,jem whistled bobwhite and dill answered in the darkness
32,not a breath blowing said jem
12,looka yonder
23, he pointed to the east
60,a gigantic moon was rising behind miss maudies pecan trees
34,that makes it seem hotter he said
19,cross in it tonight
28, asked dill not looking up
64,he was constructing a cigarette from newspaper and string
16,no just the lady
74,dont light that thing dill youll stink up this whole end of town
42, there was a lady in the moon in maycomb
45,she sat at a dresser combing her hair
33,were gonna miss you boy i said
32,reckon we better watch for mr
86, mr avery boarded across the street from mrs henry lafayette duboses house
145,besides making change in the collection plate every sunday mr avery sat on the porch every night until nine oclock and sneezed
170,one evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last for he never did it again so long as we watched
105,jem and i were leaving miss rachels front steps one night when dill stopped us golly looka yonder
26, he pointed across the street
252,at first we saw nothing but a kudzucovered front porch but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light some ten feet from source to earth it seemed to us
247,jem said mr avery misfigured dill said he must drink a gallon a day and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again as i was untalented in this area
58,dill stretched yawned and said altogether too casually
30,i know what lets go for a walk
25, he sounded fishy to me
41,nobody in maycomb just went for a walk
11,where to dill
50, dill jerked his head in a southerly direction
12,jem said okay
81, when i protested he said sweetly you dont have to come along angel may
21, you dont have to go
167,remember jem was not one to dwell on past defeats it seemed the only message he got from atticus was insight into the art of cross examination
78,scout we aint gonna do anything were just goin to the street light and back
196, we strolled silently down the sidewalk listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood listening to the soft nightmurmurs of the grown people on our street
58,occasionally we heard miss stephanie crawford laugh
13,okay said jem
29,why dont you go on home scout
23, what are you gonna do
258, dill and jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at boo radley and if i didnt want to go with them i could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut that was all
58,but what in the sam holy hill did you wait till tonight
327, because nobody could see them at night because atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldnt hear the kingdom coming because if boo radley killed them theyd miss school instead of vacation and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime did i understand
155,jem please   scout im tellin you for the last time shut your trap or go home  i declare to the lord youre gettin more like a girl every day
48, with that i had no option but to join them
131,we thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the radley lot we stood less chance of being seen
69,the fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse
56,jem held up the bottom wire and motioned dill under it
40,i followed and held up the wire for jem
34,it was a tight squeeze for him
32,dont make a sound he whispered
73,dont get in a row of collards whatever you do theyll wake the dead
72, with this thought in mind i made perhaps one step per minute
75,i moved faster when i saw jem far ahead beckoning in the moonlight
71,we came to the gate that divided the garden from the back yard
14,jem touched it
17,the gate squeaked
27,spit on it whispered dill
36,youve got us in a box jem i muttered
35,we cant get out of here so easy
16,spit on it scout
116, we spat ourselves dry and jem opened the gate slowly lifting it aside and resting it on the fence
24,we were in the back yard
183,the back of the radley house was less inviting than the front a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors
71,instead of a column a rough twobyfour supported one end of the roof
122,an old franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch above it a hatrack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily
41,arr said jem softly lifting his foot
22, chickens he breathed
140,that we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when dill ahead of us spelled god in a whisper
90,we crept to the side of the house around to the window with the hanging shutter
48,the sill was several inches taller than jem
42,give you a hand up he muttered to dill
11,wait though
142, jem grabbed his left wrist and my right wrist i grabbed my left wrist and jems right wrist we crouched and dill sat on our saddle
47,we raised him and he caught the window sill
46,hurry jem whispered we cant last much longer
64, dill punched my shoulder and we lowered him to the ground
11,whatdyousee
58,theres a little teeny light way off somewhere though
38, lets get away from here breathed jem
30,lets go round in back again
43,shh he warned me as i was about to protest
27,lets try the back window
17, dill no i said
32,dill stopped and let jem go ahead
64,when jem put his foot on the bottom step the step squeaked
51,he stood still then tried his weight by degrees
19,the step was silent
103,jem skipped two steps put his foot on the porch heaved himself to it and teetered a long moment
54,he regained his balance and dropped to his knees
58,he crawled to the window raised his head and looked in
20,then i saw the shadow
43,it was the shadow of a man with a hat on
97,at first i thought it was a tree but there was no wind blowing and treetrunks never walked
118,the back porch was bathed in moonlight and the shadow crisp as toast moved across the porch toward jem
16,dill saw it next
31,he put his hands to his face
31,when it crossed jem jem saw it
48,he put his arms over his head and went rigid
46,the shadow stopped about a foot beyond jem
56,its arm came out from its side dropped and was still
134,then it turned and moved back across jem walked along the porch and off the side of the house returning as it had come
50,jem leaped off the porch and galloped toward us
107,he flung open the gate danced dill and me through and shooed us between two rows of swishing collards
106,halfway through the collards i tripped as i tripped the roar of a shotgun shattered the neighborhood
29,dill and jem dived beside me
51,jems breath came in sobs fence by the schoolyard
12, hurry scout
173, jem held the bottom wire dill and i rolled through and were halfway to the shelter of the schoolyards solitary oak when we sensed that jem was not with us
95,we ran back and found him struggling in the fence kicking his pants off to get loose
38,he ran to the oak tree in his shorts
109,safely behind it we gave way to numbness but jems mind was racing we gotta get home theyll miss us
195, we ran across the schoolyard crawled under the fence to deers pasture behind our house climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before jem would let us pause to rest
99,respiration normal the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front yard
90,we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the radley front gate
32,we better go down there said jem
46,theyll think its funny if we dont show up
92, mr nathan radley was standing inside his gate a shotgun broken across his arm
72,atticus was standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford
38,miss rachel and mr avery were near by
27,none of them saw us come up
47,we eased in beside miss maudie who looked around
57,where were you all didnt you hear the commotion
15, what happened
50,mr radley shot at a negro in his collard patch
14,did he hit him
25, no said miss stephanie
14,shot in the air
22,scared him pale though
61,says if anybody sees a white nigger around thats the one
152,says hes got the other barrel waitin for the next sound he hears in that patch an next time he wont aim high be it dog nigger or  jem finch
13,atticus spoke
21,wherere your pants son
16, it was no use
40,in his shorts before god and everybody
149, in the glare from the streetlight i could see dill hatching one his eyes widened his fat cherub face grew rounder
14,what is it dill
13, asked atticus
40,ah  i won em from him he said vaguely
39, dills hand sought the back of his head
47,he brought it forward and across his forehead
67,we were playin strip poker up yonder by the fishpool he said
18,jem and i relaxed
57,the neighbors seemed satisfied they all stiffened
24,but what was strip poker
106,we had no chance to find out miss rachel went off like the town fire siren do oo jeesus dill harris
23,gamblin by my fishpool
24,ill strippoker you sir
51, atticus saved dill from immediate dismemberment
36,just a minute miss rachel he said
43,ive never heard of em doing that before
27,were you all playing cards
69, jem fielded dills fly with his eyes shut no sir just with matches
22, i admired my brother
47,matches were dangerous but cards were fatal
74,jem scout said atticus i dont want to hear of poker in any form again
38,go by dills and get your pants jem
20,settle it yourselves
89, dont worry dill said jem as we trotted up the sidewalk she aint gonna get you
23,hell talk her out of it
27,that was fast thinkin son
37, we stopped and heard atticuss voice
11,not serious
87,they all go through it miss rachel dill was comforted but jem and i werent
72,there was the problem of jem showing up some pants in the morning
71,d give you some of mine said dill as we came to miss rachels steps
52,jem said he couldnt get in them but thanks anyway
52,we said goodbye and dill went inside the house
110,he evidently remembered he was engaged to me for he ran back out and kissed me swiftly in front of jem
15,yawl write hear
20, he bawled after us
77,had jems pants been safely on him we would not have slept much anyway
431,every nightsound i heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three fold every scratch of feet on gravel was boo radley seeking revenge every passing negro laughing in the night was boo radley loose and after us insects splashing against the screen were boo radleys insane fingers picking the wire to pieces the chinaberry trees were malignant hovering alive
74,i lingered between sleep and wakefulness until i heard jem murmur
23,sleep little threeeyes
14, are you crazy
24, shh atticuss lights out
65, in the waning moonlight i saw jem swing his feet to the floor
25,im goin after em he said
13,i sat upright
15,i wont let you
38, he was struggling into his shirt
32, you do an ill wake up atticus
25, you do and ill kill you
43, i pulled him down beside me on the cot
26,i tried to reason with him
44,mr nathans gonna find em in the morning jem
19,he knows you lost em
82,when he shows em to atticus itll be pretty bad thats all there is to it
14,gon back to bed
26, thats what i know said jem
26,thats why im goin after em
21, i began to feel sick
172,going back to that place by himself  i remembered miss stephanie mr nathan had the other barrel waiting for the next sound he heard be it nigger dog
74,jem knew that better than i i was desperate look it aint worth it jem
32,a lickin hurts but it doesnt last
39,youll get your head shot off jem
33, he blew out his breath patiently
32,i  its like this scout he muttered
52,atticus aint ever whipped me since i can remember
23,i wanta keep it that way
21, this was a thought
55,it seemed that atticus threatened us every other day
44,you mean hes never caught you at anything
52, maybe so but  i just wanta keep it that way scout
35,we shouldna done that tonight scout
72, it was then i suppose that jem and i first began to part company
88,sometimes i did not understand him but my periods of bewilderment were shortlived
18,this was beyond me
105,please i pleaded cantcha just think about it for a minute  by yourself on that place   shut up
57, its not like hed never speak to you again or somethin 
99,im gonna wake him up jem i swear i am   jem grabbed my pajama collar and wrenched it tight
33,then im goin with you   i choked
39,no you aint youll just make noise
13, it was no use
76,i unlatched the back door and held it while he crept down the steps
29,it must have been two oclock
88,the moon was setting and the latticework shadows were fading into fuzzy nothingness
118,jems white shirttail dipped and bobbed like a small ghost dancing away to escape the coming morning
68,a faint breeze stirred and cooled the sweat running down my sides
153,he went the back way through deers pasture across the schoolyard and around to the fence i thought  at least that was the way he was headed
50,it would take longer so it was not time to worry yet
80,i waited until it was time to worry and listened for mr radleys shotgun
47,then i thought i heard the back fence squeak
24,it was wishful thinking
26,then i heard atticus cough
16,i held my breath
91,sometimes when we made a midnight pilgrimage to the bathroom we would find him reading
94,he said he often woke up during the night checked on us and read himself back to sleep
79,i waited for his light to go on straining my eyes to see it flood the hall
37,it stayed off and i breathed again
173,the nightcrawlers had retired but ripe chinaberries drummed on the roof when the wind stirred and the darkness was desolate with the barking of distant dogs
27,there he was returning to me
69,his white shirt bobbed over the back fence and slowly grew larger
75,he came up the back steps latched the door behind him and sat on his cot
31,wordlessly he held up his pants
59,he lay down and for a while i heard his cot trembling
18,soon he was still
31,i did not hear him stir again
75,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem stayed moody and silent for a week
225,as atticus had once advised me to do i tried to climb into jems skin and walk around in it if i had gone alone to the radley place at two in the morning my funeral would have been held the next afternoon
57,so i left jem alone and tried not to bother him
13,school started
133,the second grade was as bad as the first only worse  they still flashed cards at you and wouldnt let you read or write
182,miss carolines progress next door could be estimated by the frequency of laughter however the usual crew had flunked the first grade again and were helpful in keeping order
162,the only thing good about the second grade was that this year i had to stay as late as jem and we usually walked home together at three oclock
123,one afternoon when we were crossing the schoolyard toward home jem suddenly said theres something i didnt tell you
97, as this was his first complete sentence in several days i encouraged him about what
18, about that night
57, youve never told me anything about that night i said
46,jem waved my words away as if fanning gnats
168,he was silent for a while then he said when i went back for my breeches  they were all in a tangle when i was gettin out of em i couldnt get em loose
45,when i went back   jem took a deep breath
54,when i went back they were folded across the fence
27,like they were expectin me
50, across and something else   jems voice was flat
26,show you when we get home
20,theyd been sewed up
53,not like a lady sewed em like somethin id try to do
11,all crooked
67,its almost like     somebody knew you were comin back for em
14, jem shuddered
83,like somebody was readin my mind like somebody could tell what i was gonna do
68,cant anybody tell what im gonna do lest they know me can they scout
27, jems question was an appeal
133,i reassured him cant anybody tell what youre gonna do lest they live in the house with you and even i cant tell sometimes
31, we were walking past our tree
47,in its knothole rested a ball of gray twine
22,dont take it jem i said
31,this is somebodys hidin place
22, i dont think so scout
137,somebody like walter cunningham comes down here every recess and hides his things  and we come along and take em away from him
48,listen lets leave it and wait a couple of days
39,if it aint gone then well take it okay
41, okay you might be right said jem
76,it must be some little kids place  hides his things from the bigger folks
62,you know its only when schools in that weve found things
59, yeah i said but we never go by here in the summertime
13, we went home
51,next morning the twine was where we had left it
62,when it was still there on the third day jem pocketed it
82,from then on we considered everything we found in the knothole our property
240, the second grade was grim but jem assured me that the older i got the better school would be that he started off the same way and it was not until one reached the sixth grade that one learned anything of value
271,the sixth grade seemed to please him from the beginning he went through a brief egyptian period that baffled me  he tried to walk flat a great deal sticking one arm in front of him and one in back of him putting one foot behind the other
284,he declared egyptians walked that way i said if they did i didnt see how they got anything done but jem said they accomplished more than the americans ever did they invented toilet paper and perpetual embalming and asked where would we be today if they hadnt
66,atticus told me to delete the adjectives and id have the facts
209,there are no clearly defined seasons in south alabama summer drifts into autumn and autumn is sometimes never followed by winter but turns to a days old spring that melts into summer again
69,that fall was a long one hardly cool enough for a light jacket
113,jem and i were trotting in our orbit one mild october afternoon when our knothole stopped us again
38,something white was inside this time
77,jem let me do the honors i pulled out two small images carved in soap
60,one was the figure of a boy the other wore a crude dress
102,before i remembered that there was no such thing as hoodooing i shrieked and threw them down
21,jem snatched them up
27,whats the matter with you
41,he rubbed the figures free of red dust
24,these are good he said
30,ive never seen any these good
25, he held them down to me
53,they were almost perfect miniatures of two children
74,the boy had on shorts and a shock of soapy hair fell to his eyebrows
18,i looked up at jem
67,a point of straight brown hair kicked downwards from his part
29,i had never noticed it before
40,jem looked from the girldoll to me
23,the girldoll wore bangs
21,these are us he said
22,who did em you reckon
41, who do we know around here who whittles
30, mr avery just does like this
12,i mean carves
108, mr avery averaged a stick of stovewood per week he honed it down to a toothpick and chewed it
59,theres old miss stephanie crawfords sweetheart i said
55,he carves all right but he lives down the country
44,when would he ever pay any attention to us
75, maybe he sits on the porch and looks at us instead of miss stephanie
20,if i was him i would
98, jem stared at me so long i asked what was the matter but got nothing scout for an answer
57,when we went home jem put the dolls in his trunk
188,less than two weeks later we found a whole package of chewing gum which we enjoyed the fact that everything on the radley place was poison having slipped jems memory
59,the following week the knothole yielded a tarnished medal
196,jem showed it to atticus who said it was a spelling medal that before we were born the maycomb county schools had spelling contests and awarded medals to the winners
64,atticus said someone must have lost it and had we asked around
63,jem camelkicked me when i tried to say where we had found it
83,jem asked atticus if he remembered anybody who ever won one and atticus said no
44,our biggest prize appeared four days later
78,it was a pocket watch that wouldnt run on a chain with an aluminum knife
31,you reckon its white gold jem
22,ill show it to atticus
90, atticus said it would probably be worth ten dollars knife chain and all if it were new
40,did you swap with somebody at school
129, jem pulled out his grandfathers watch that atticus let him carry once a week if jem were careful with it
58,on the days he carried the watch jem walked on eggs
67,atticus if its all right with you id rather have this one instead
18,maybe i can fix it
188, when the new wore off his grandfathers watch and carrying it became a days burdensome task jem no longer felt the necessity of ascertaining the hour every five minutes
100,he did a fair job only one spring and two tiny pieces left over but the watch would not run
25,ohh he sighed itll never go
79, you reckon we oughta write a letter to whoever s leaving us these things
57, thatd be right nice jem we can thank em  whats wrong
65, jem was holding his ears shaking his head from side to side
59,i dont get it i just dont get it  i dont know why scout
31, he looked toward the livingroom
54,ive gotta good mind to tell atticus  no i reckon not
21, ill tell him for you
22, no dont do that scout
157, he had been on the verge of telling me something all evening his face would brighten and he would lean toward me then he would change his mind
20,he changed it again
27, here lets write a letter
45, i pushed a tablet and pencil under his nose
37,dear mister how do you know its a man
61,i bet its miss maudie  been bettin that for a long time
59, arr miss maudie cant chew gum   jem broke into a grin
46,you know she can talk real pretty sometimes
165,one time i asked her to have a chew and she said no thanks that  chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless said jem carefully
23,doesnt that sound nice
38, yeah she can say nice things sometimes
43,she wouldnt have a watch and chain anyway
16, dear sir said jem
93,we appreciate the  no we appreciate everything which you have put into the tree for us
38,yours very truly jeremy atticus finch
57, he wont know who you are if you sign it like that jem
43, jem erased his name and wrote jem finch
48, i signed jean louise finch scout beneath it
32,jem put the note in an envelope
87,next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree
70,jem was facing me when he looked up and i saw him go stark white
12, i ran to him
50,someone had filled our knothole with cement
23,dont you cry now scout
76,dont cry now dont you worry he muttered at me all the way to school
97,when we went home for dinner jem bolted his food ran to the porch and stood on the steps
15,i followed him
31,hasnt passed by yet he said
50,next day jem repeated his vigil and was rewarded
27,hidy do mr nathan he said
50,morning jem scout said mr radley as he went by
19,mr radley said jem
26,mr radley turned around
81,mr radley ah  did you put cement in that hole in that tree down yonder
12, yes he said
17,i filled it up
16, whydyoudoit sir
13, trees dying
43,you plug em with cement when theyre sick
25,you ought to know that jem
55, jem said nothing more about it until late afternoon
104,when we passed our tree he gave it a meditative pat on its cement and remained deep in thought
78,he seemed to be working himself into a bad humor so i kept my distance
64,as usual we met atticus coming home from work that evening
88,when we were at our steps jem said atticus look down yonder at that tree please sir
12, what tree son
63, the one on the corner of the radley lot comin from school
18, is that tree dyin
27, why no son i dont think so
102,look at the leaves theyre all green and full no brown patches anywhere   it aint even sick
38, that trees as healthy as you are jem
36, mr nathan radley said it was dyin
18, well maybe it is
57,im sure mr radley knows more about his trees than we do
31, atticus left us on the porch
58,jem leaned on a pillar rubbing his shoulders against it
15,do you itch jem
30, i asked as politely as i could
18,he did not answer
23,come on in jem i said
10,after while
55, he stood there until nightfall and i waited for him
157,when we went in the house i saw he had been crying his face was dirty in the right places but i thought it odd that i had not heard him
161,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  for reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in maycomb county autumn turned to winter that year
63,we had two weeks of the coldest weather since  atticus said
365,mr avery said it was written on the rosetta stone that when children disobeyed their parents smoked cigarettes and made war on each other the seasons would change jem and i were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of nature thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to ourselves
155,old mrs radley died that winter but her death caused hardly a ripple  the neighborhood seldom saw her except when she watered her carinas
165,jem and i decided that boo had got her at last but when atticus returned from the radley house he said she died of natural causes to our disappointment
22,ask him jem whispered
30,you ask him youre the oldest
31, thats why you oughta ask him
33, atticus i said did you see mr
66, atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me i did not
44, jem restrained me from further questions
103,he said atticus was still touchous about us and the radleys and it wouldnt do to push him any
126,jem had a notion that atticus thought our activities that night last summer were not solely confined to strip poker
72,jem had no firm basis for his ideas he said it was merely a twitch
75,next morning i awoke looked out the window and nearly died of fright
57,my screams brought atticus from his bathroom halfshaven
24,the worlds endin atticus
20,please do something  
43, i dragged him to the window and pointed
20,no its not he said
11,its snowing
36, jem asked atticus would it keep up
56,jem had never seen snow either but he knew what it was
64,atticus said he didnt know any more about snow than jem did
64,i think though if its watery like that itll turn to rain
76, the telephone rang and atticus left the breakfast table to answer it
48,that was eula may he said when he returned
89,i quote  as it has not snowed in maycomb county since  there will be no school today
52, eula may was maycomb s leading telephone operator
173,she was entrusted with issuing public announcements wedding invitations setting off the fire siren and giving firstaid instructions when dr reynolds was away
151,when atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of out the windows jem asked how do you make a snowman
44, i havent the slightest idea said atticus
105,i dont want you all to be disappointed but i doubt if therell be enough snow for a snowball even
63, calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking
89,when we ran to the back yard it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow
41,we shouldnt walk about in it said jem
39,look every step you takes wasting it
37, i looked back at my mushy footprints
97,jem said if we waited until it snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman
48,i stuck out my tongue and caught a fat flake
12,jem its hot
35, no it aint its so cold it burns
39,now dont eat it scout youre wasting it
18,let it come down
25, but i want to walk in it
48, i know what we can go walk over at miss maudies
36, jem hopped across the front yard
23,i followed in his tracks
88,when we were on the sidewalk in front of miss maudies mr avery accosted us
52,he had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt
19,see what youve done
44,hasnt snowed in maycomb since appomattox
53,its bad children like you makes the seasons change
192, i wondered if mr avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer for him to repeat his performance and reflected that if this was our reward there was something to say for sin
121,i did not wonder where mr avery gathered his meteorological statistics they came straight from the rosetta stone
24,jem finch you jem finch
27, miss maudies callin you jem
41, you all stay in the middle of the yard
59,theres some thrift buried under the snow near the porch
13,dont step on it
11, called jem
35,its beautiful aint it miss maudie
24, beautiful my hind foot
56,if it freezes tonight itll carry off all my azaleas
60, miss maudies old sunhat glistened with snow crystals
69,she was bending over some small bushes wrapping them in burlap bags
45,jem asked her what she was doing that for
22,keep em warm she said
27,how can flowers keep warm
20,they dont circulate
42, i cannot answer that question jem finch
93,all i know is if it freezes tonight these plantsll freeze so you cover em up
13,is that clear
10,miss maudie
47, could scout and me borrow some of your snow
28, heavens alive take it all
69,theres an old peach basket under the house haul it off in that
27, miss maudies eyes narrowed
57,jem finch what are you going to do with my snow
124, youll see said jem and we transferred as much snow as we could from miss maudies yard to ours a slushy operation
26,what are we gonna do jem
18,youll see he said
97,now get the basket and haul all the snow you can rake up from the back yard to the front
47,walk back in your tracks though he cautioned
34,are we gonna have a snow baby jem
18, no a real snowman
19,gotta work hard now
152, jem ran to the back yard produced the garden hoe and began digging quickly behind the woodpile placing any worms he found to one side
115,he went in the house returned with the laundry hamper filled it with earth and carried it to the front yard
104,when we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow jem said we were ready to begin
38,dont you think this is kind of a mess
44,looks messy now but it wont later he said
141,jem scooped up an armful of dirt patted it into a mound on which he added another load and another until he had constructed a torso
50,jem i aint ever heard of a nigger snowman i said
33,he wont be black long he grunted
133,jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard plaited them and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt
68,he looks like stephanie crawford with her hands on her hips i said
40,fat in the middle and littlebitty arms
19, ill make em bigger
62, jem sloshed water over the mud man and added more dirt
113,he looked thoughtfully at it for a moment then he molded a big stomach below the figures waistline
87,jem glanced at me his eyes twinkling mr averys sort of shaped like a snowman aint he
56, jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on
81,he permitted me to cover only the back saving the public parts for himself
32,gradually mr avery turned white
99,using bits of wood for eyes nose mouth and buttons jem succeeded in making mr avery look cross
45,a stick of stovewood completed the picture
40,jem stepped back and viewed his creation
21,its lovely jem i said
36,looks almost like hed talk to you
15, it is aint it
14, he said shyly
107,we could not wait for atticus to come home for dinner but called and said we had a big surprise for him
128,he seemed surprised when he saw most of the back yard in the front yard but he said we had done a jimdandy job
159,i didnt know how you were going to do it he said to jem but from now on ill never worry about whatll become of you son youll always have an idea
115, jems ears reddened from atticuss compliment but he looked up sharply when he saw atticus stepping back
42,atticus squinted at the snowman a while
22,he grinned then laughed
86,son i cant tell what youre going to be  an engineer a lawyer or a portrait painter
57,youve perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard
34,weve got to disguise this fellow
132, atticus suggested that jem hone down his creations front a little swap a broom for the stovewood and put an apron on him
94,jem explained that if he did the snowman would become muddy and cease to be a snowman
66,i dont care what you do so long as you do something said atticus
62,you cant go around making caricatures of the neighbors
32, aint a characterture said jem
23,it looks just like him
28, mr avery might not think so
12, i know what
101,he raced across the street disappeared into miss maudies back yard and returned triumphant
102,he stuck her sunhat on the snowmans head and jammed her hedgeclippers into the crook of his arm
32,atticus said that would be fine
67,miss maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch
37,she looked across the street at us
20,suddenly she grinned
21,jem finch she called
36,you devil bring me back my hat sir
46, jem looked up at atticus who shook his head
26,shes just fussing he said
53,shes really impressed with your  accomplishments
153, atticus strolled over to miss maudies sidewalk where they engaged in an arm waving conversation the only phrase of which i caught was 
41,erected an absolute morphodite in that yard
28,atticus youll never raise em
195, the snow stopped in the afternoon the temperature dropped and by nightfall mr averys direst predictions came true calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house blazing but we were cold
132,when atticus came home that evening he said we were in for it and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night
124,calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought shed be warmer at her house
37,atticus drove her home in the car
68,before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room
145,he said the thermometer registered sixteen that it was the coldest night in his memory and that our snowman outside was frozen solid
65,minutes later it seemed i was awakened by someone shaking me
42,atticus s overcoat was spread across me
23,is it morning already
12, baby get up
49, atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat
32,put your robe on first he said
46,jem was standing beside atticus groggy and tousled
95,he was holding his overcoat closed at the neck his other hand was jammed into his pocket
33,he looked strangely overweight
21,hurry hon said atticus
26,herere your shoes and socks
23, stupidly i put them on
14,is it morning
28, no its a little after one
54, that something was wrong finally got through to me
16,whats the matter
41, by then he did not have to tell me
107,just as the birds know where to go when it rains i knew when there was trouble in our street
91,soft taffetalike sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless dread
11,whose is it
38, miss maudies hon said atticus gently
74,at the front door we saw fire spewing from miss maudies diningroom windows
133,as if to confirm what we saw the town fire siren wailed up the scale to a treble pitch and remained there screaming
16,its gone aint it
11, moaned jem
25,i expect so said atticus
23,now listen both of you
49,go down and stand in front of the radley place
31,keep out of the way do you hear
30,see which way the winds blowing
13, oh said jem
61,atticus reckon we oughta start moving the furniture out
12, not yet son
15,do as i tell you
29,take care of scout you hear
31,dont let her out of your sight
64, with a push atticus started us toward the radley front gate
112,we stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently devoured miss maudies house
44,why dont they hurry why dont they hurry
14, muttered jem
96,the old fire truck killed by the cold was being pushed from town by a crowd of men
111,when the men attached its hose to a hydrant the hose burst and water shot up tinkling down on the pavement
41,ohh lord jem jem put his arm around me
19,hush scout he said
27,it aint time to worry yet
23,ill let you know when
133, the men of maycomb in all degrees of dress and undress took furniture from miss maudies house to a yard across the street
134,i saw atticus carrying miss maudies heavy oak rocking chair and thought it sensible of him to save what she valued most
27,sometimes we heard shouts
53,then mr averys face appeared in an upstairs window
132,he pushed a mattress out the window into the street and threw down furniture until men shouted come down from there dick
21,the stairs are going
18,get outta there mr
48, mr avery began climbing through the window
15,scout hes stuck
14, breathed jem
26,mr avery was wedged tightly
103,i buried my head under jems arm and didnt look again until jem cried hes got loose scout
12,hes all right
57, i looked up to see mr avery cross the upstairs porch
93,he swung his legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped
49,he fell yelled and hit miss maudies shrubbery
117,suddenly i noticed that the men were backing away from miss maudies house moving down the street toward us
41,they were no longer carrying furniture
142,the fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way to the roof window frames were black against a vivid orange center
43,jem it looks like a pumpkin   scout look
131, smoke was rolling off our house and miss rachels house like fog off a riverbank and men were pulling hoses toward them
115,behind us the fire truck from abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front of our house
17,that book i said
43,that tom swift book it aint mine its dills
53,dont worry scout it aint time to worry yet said jem
13,looka yonder
88, in a group of neighbors atticus was standing with his hands in his overcoat pockets
44,he might have been watching a football game
28,miss maudie was beside him
41,see there hes not worried yet said jem
41,why aint he on top of one of the houses
31, hes too old hed break his neck
55, you think we oughta make him get our stuff out
59, lets dont pester him hell know when its time said jem
133,the abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house a man on the roof pointed to places that needed it most
111,i watched our absolute morphodite go black and crumble miss maudies sunhat settled on top of the heap
35,i could not see her hedgeclippers
113,in the heat between our house miss rachels and miss maudies the men had long ago shed coats and bathrobes
143,they worked in pajama tops and nightshirts stuffed into their pants but i became aware that i was slowly freezing where i stood
60,jem tried to keep me warm but his arm was not enough
47,i pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders
40,by dancing a little i could feel my feet
85,another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of miss stephanie crawfords
111,there was no hydrant for another hose and the men tried to soak her house with hand extinguishers
43,miss maudies tin roof quelled the flames
184,roaring the house collapsed fire gushed everywhere followed by a flurry of blankets from men on top of the adjacent houses beating out sparks and burning chunks of wood
79,it was dawn before the men began to leave first one by one then in groups
114,they pushed the maycomb fire truck back to town the abbottsville truck departed the third one remained
74,we found out next day it had come from clarks ferry sixty miles away
32,jem and i slid across the street
144,miss maudie was staring at the smoking black hole in her yard and atticus shook his head to tell us she did not want to talk
74,he led us home holding onto our shoulders to cross the icy street
74,he said miss maudie would stay with miss stephanie for the time being
33,anybody want some hot chocolate
65,i shuddered when atticus started a fire in the kitchen stove
101,as we drank our cocoa i noticed atticus looking at me first with curiosity then with sternness
56,i thought i told you and jem to stay put he said
38,we stayed then whose blanket is that
17, yes maam blanket
12,it isnt ours
140, i looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket i was wearing around my shoulders squawfashion
26,atticus i dont know sir
81,i   i turned to jem for an answer but jem was even more bewildered than i
182,he said he didnt know how it got there we did exactly as atticus had told us we stood down by the radley gate away from everybody we didnt move an inch  jem stopped
115,mr nathan was at the fire he babbled i saw him i saw him he was tuggin that mattress  atticus i swear
22, thats all right son
25, atticus grinned slowly
67,looks like all of maycomb was out tonight in one way or another
55,jem theres some wrapping paper in the pantry i think
36,go get it and well   atticus no sir
36, jem seemed to have lost his mind
162,he began pouring out our secrets right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own omitting nothing knothole pants and all
310,nathan put cement in that tree atticus an he did it to stop us findin things  hes crazy i reckon like they say but atticus i swear to god he aint ever harmed us he aint ever hurt us he coulda cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants instead
100,he aint ever hurt us atticus   atticus said whoa son so gently that i was greatly heartened
98,it was obvious that he had not followed a word jem said for all atticus said was youre right
51,wed better keep this and the blanket to ourselves
59,someday maybe scout can thank him for covering her up
100,you were so busy looking at the fire you didnt know it when he put the blanket around you
112, my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket and crept toward me
81,he sneaked out of the house  turn round  sneaked up an went like this
76, atticus said dryly do not let this inspire you to further glory jeremy
114, jem scowled i aint gonna do anything to him but i watched the spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes
71,just think scout he said if youd just turned around you da seen him
26, calpurnia woke us at noon
91,atticus had said we need not go to school that day wed learn nothing after no sleep
55,calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the front yard
142,miss maudies sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice like a fly in amber and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedgeclippers
72,we found her in her back yard gazing at her frozen charred azaleas
52,were bringing back your things miss maudie said jem
16,were awful sorry
81, miss maudie looked around and the shadow of her old grin crossed her face
39,always wanted a smaller house jem finch
19,gives me more yard
54,just think ill have more room for my azaleas now
32, you aint grievin miss maudie
19, i asked surprised
48,atticus said her house was nearly all she had
15,grieving child
30,why i hated that old cow barn
82,thought of settin fire to it a hundred times myself except theyd lock me up
48, but dont you worry about me jean louise finch
56,there are ways of doing things you dont know about
125,why ill build me a little house and take me a couple of roomers and  gracious ill have the finest yard in alabama
59,those bellingrathsll look plain puny when i get started
35, jem and i looked at each other
24,howd it catch miss maudie
16,i dont know jem
37,probably the flue in the kitchen
60,i kept a fire in there last night for my potted plants
68,hear you had some unexpected company last night miss jean louise
14, howd you know
52, atticus told me on his way to town this morning
51,tell you the truth id like tove been with you
46,and idve had sense enough to turn around too
24, miss maudie puzzled me
145,with most of her possessions gone and her beloved yard a shambles she still took a lively and cordial interest in jems and my affairs
35,she must have seen my perplexity
98,she said only thing i worried about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused
45,this whole neighborhood could have gone up
56,mr averyll be in bed for a week  hes right stove up
52,hes too old to do things like that and i told him so
120,soon as i can get my hands clean and when stephanie crawfords not looking ill make him a lane cake
169,that stephanies been after my recipe for thirty years and if she thinks ill give it to her just because im staying with her shes got another think coming
110, i reflected that if miss maudie broke down and gave it to her miss stephanie couldnt follow it anyway
110,miss maudie had once let me see it among other things the recipe called for one large cup of sugar
18,it was a still day
118,the air was so cold and clear we heard the courthouse clock clank rattle and strain before it struck the hour
84,miss maudie s nose was a color i had never seen before and i inquired about it
44,ive been out here since six oclock she said
24,should be frozen by now
21, she held up her hands
86,a network of tiny lines crisscrossed her palms brown with dirt and dried blood
25,youve ruined em said jem
31,why dont you get a colored man
87, there was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added or scoutnme we can help you
81, miss maudie said thank you sir but youve got a job of your own over there
26, she pointed to our yard
25,you mean the morphodite
37,shoot we can rake him up in a jiffy
62, miss maudie stared down at me her lips moving silently
52,suddenly she put her hands to her head and whooped
42,when we left her she was still chuckling
87,jem said he didnt know what was the matter with her  that was just miss maudie
65,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  you can just take that back boy
103, this order given by me to cecil jacobs was the beginning of a rather thin time for jem and me
52,my fists were clenched and i was ready to let fly
231,atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more i was far too old and too big for such childish things and the sooner i learned to hold in the better off everybody would be
12,i soon forgot
27,cecil jacobs made me forget
98,he had announced in the schoolyard the day before that scout finchs daddy defended niggers
23,i denied it but told jem
26,whatd he mean sayin that
17,nothing jem said
25,ask atticus hell tell you
31, do you defend niggers atticus
24, i asked him that evening
14,of course i do
21,dont say nigger scout
12,thats common
35, s what everybody at school says
135, from now on itll be everybody less one   well if you dont want me to grow up talkin that way why do you send me to school
53, my father looked at me mildly amusement in his eyes
252,despite our compromise my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first days dose of it the beginning of last september had brought on sinking spells dizziness and mild gastric complaints
177,i went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachels cooks son who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm
14,it didnt take
33,but i was worrying another bone
38,do all lawyers defend nnegroes atticus
25, of course they do scout
47, then why did cecil say you defended niggers
49,he made it sound like you were runnin a still
15, atticus sighed
54,im simply defending a negro  his names tom robinson
54,he lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump
70,hes a member of calpurnias church and cal knows his family well
34,she says theyre cleanliving folks
182,scout you arent old enough to understand some things yet but theres been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldnt do much about defending this man
68,its a peculiar case  it wont come to trial until summer session
54,john taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement
66, if you shouldnt be defendin him then why are you doin it
40, for a number of reasons said atticus
193,the main one is if i didnt i couldnt hold up my head in town i couldnt represent this county in the legislature i couldnt even tell you or jem not to do something again
98, you mean if you didnt defend that man jem and me wouldnt have to mind you any more
20, thats about right
55, because i could never ask you to mind me again
136,scout simply by the nature of the work every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally
25,this ones mine i guess
157,you might hear some ugly talk about it at school but do one thing for me if you will you just hold your head high and keep those fists down
68,no matter what anybody says to you dont you let em get your goat
45,try fighting with your head for a change
47,its a good one even if it does resist learning
33, atticus are we going to win it
140, then why simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win atticus said
40,you sound like cousin ike finch i said
76,cousin ike finch was maycomb countys sole surviving confederate veteran
73,he wore a general hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain
89,at least once a year atticus jem and i called on him and i would have to kiss him
14,it was horrible
91,jem and i would listen respectfully to atticus and cousin ike rehash the war
261,tell you atticus cousin ike would say the missouri compromise was what licked us but if i had to go through it agin id walk every step of the way there an every step back jist like i did before an furthermore wed whip em this time
82,now in  when stonewall jackson came around by  i beg your pardon young folks
59, blue light was in heaven then god rest his saintly brow
30, come here scout said atticus
60,i crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin
49,he put his arms around me and rocked me gently
31,its different this time he said
78,this time we arent fighting the yankees were fighting our friends
117,but remember this no matter how bitter things get theyre still our friends and this is still our home
108, with this in mind i faced cecil jacobs in the schoolyard next day you gonna take that back boy
25, you gotta make me first
93,my folks said your daddy was a disgrace an that nigger oughta hang from the watertank
127, i drew a bead on him remembered what atticus had said then dropped my fists and walked away scouts a cow  ward
21, ringing in my ears
59,it was the first time i ever walked away from a fight
53,somehow if i fought cecil i would let atticus down
110,atticus so rarely asked jem and me to do something for him i could take being called a coward for him
91,i felt extremely noble for having remembered and remained noble for three weeks
43,then christmas came and disaster struck
50,jem and i viewed christmas with mixed feelings
49,the good side was the tree and uncle jack finch
109,every christmas eve day we met uncle jack at maycomb junction and he would spend a week with us
100,a flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of aunt alexandra and francis
204,i suppose i should include uncle jimmy aunt alexandras husband but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say get off the fence once i never saw any reason to take notice of him
28,neither did aunt alexandra
186,long ago in a burst of friendliness aunty and uncle jimmy produced a son named henry who left home as soon as was humanly possible married and produced francis
126,henry and his wife deposited francis at his grandparents every christmas then pursued their own pleasures
88,no amount of sighing could induce atticus to let us spend christmas day at home
61,we went to finchs landing every christmas in my memory
135,the fact that aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with francis hancock
146,he was a year older than i and i avoided him on principle he enjoyed everything i disapproved of and disliked my ingenuous diversions
245,aunt alexandra was atticuss sister but when jem told me about changelings and siblings i decided that she had been swapped at birth that my grandparents had perhaps received a crawford instead of a finch
229,had i ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges aunt alexandra would have been analogous to mount everest throughout my early life she was cold and there
129,when uncle jack jumped down from the train christmas eve day we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages
143,jem and i always thought it funny when uncle jack pecked atticus on the cheek they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other
194,uncle jack shook hands with jem and swung me high but not high enough uncle jack was a head shorter than atticus the baby of the family he was younger than aunt alexandra
133,he and aunty looked alike but uncle jack made better use of his face we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin
117,he was one of the few men of science who never terrified me probably because he never behaved like a doctor
276,whenever he performed a minor service for jem and me as removing a splinter from a foot he would tell us exactly what he was going to do give us an estimation of how much it would hurt and explain the use of any tongs he employed
121,one christmas i lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot permitting no one to come near me
276,when uncle jack caught me he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressinggown smoking a hookah and delivering fiveminute sermons to any passersby who desired spiritual comfort
225,i interrupted to make uncle jack let me know when he would pull it out but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while i was laughing that was what was known as relativity
23,whats in those packages
77, i asked him pointing to the long thin parcels the porter had given him
31,none of your business he said
26,jem said hows rose aylmer
35, rose aylmer was uncle jacks cat
114,she was a beautiful yellow female uncle jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently
70,he reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots
15,we admired them
22,shes gettin fat i said
18,i should think so
68,she eats all the leftover fingers and ears from the hospital
30, aw thats a damn story i said
18,i beg your pardon
55, atticus said dont pay any attention to her jack
21,shes trying you out
53,cal says shes been cussing fluently for a week now
49, uncle jack raised his eyebrows and said nothing
185,i was proceeding on the dim theory aside from the innate attractiveness of such words that if atticus discovered i had picked them up at school he wouldnt make me go
102,but at supper that evening when i asked him to pass the damn ham please uncle jack pointed at me
38,see me afterwards young lady he said
73,when supper was over uncle jack went to the livingroom and sat down
52,he slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap
85,i liked to smell him he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet
43,he pushed back my bangs and looked at me
51,youre more like atticus than your mother he said
47,youre also growing out of your pants a little
29, i reckon they fit all right
52, you like words like damn and hell now dont you
22, i said i reckoned so
89,well i dont said uncle jack not unless theres extreme provocation connected with em
87,ill be here a week and i dont want to hear any words like that while im here
75,scout youll get in trouble if you go around saying things like that
45,you want to grow up to be a lady dont you
25, i said not particularly
16,of course you do
25,now lets get to the tree
111, we decorated the tree until bedtime and that night i dreamed of the two long packages for jem and me
155,next morning jem and i dived for them they were from atticus who had written uncle jack to get them for us and they were what we had asked for
88,dont point them in the house said atticus when jem aimed at a picture on the wall
51,youll have to teach em to shoot said uncle jack
29,thats your job said atticus
35,i merely bowed to the inevitable
69, it took atticuss courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree
199,he declined to let us take our air rifles to the landing i had already begun to think of shooting francis and said if we made one false move hed take them away from us for good
116,finchs landing consisted of three hundred and sixtysix steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty
219,farther down stream beyond the bluff were traces of an old cotton landing where finch negroes had loaded bales and produce unloaded blocks of ice flour and sugar farm equipment and feminine apparel
74,a tworut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees
112,at the end of the road was a twostoried white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs
171,in his old age our ancestor simon finch had built it to please his nagging wife but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended
158,the internal arrangements of the finch house were indicative of simons guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring
142,there were six bedrooms upstairs four for the eight female children one for welcome finch the sole son and one for visiting relatives
139,simple enough but the daughters rooms could be reached only by one staircase welcomes room and the guestroom only by another
189,the daughters staircase was in the ground floor bedroom of their parents so simon always knew the hours of his daughters nocturnal comings and goings
429,there was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole used to summon field hands or as a distress signal a widows walk was on the roof but no widows walked there  from it simon oversaw his overseer watched the riverboats and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders
321,there went with the house the usual legend about the yankees one finch female recently engaged donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood she became stuck in the door to the daughters staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through
228,when we arrived at the landing aunt alexandra kissed uncle jack francis kissed uncle jack uncle jimmy shook hands silently with uncle jack jem and i gave our presents to francis who gave us a present
91,jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults leaving me to entertain our cousin
45,francis was eight and slicked back his hair
29,whatd you get for christmas
16, i asked politely
28,just what i asked for he said
106,francis had requested a pair of kneepants a red leather booksack five shirts and an untied bow tie
15,thats nice i lied
81,jem and me got air rifles and jem got a chemistry set   a toy one i reckon
14, no a real one
76,hes gonna make me some invisible ink and im gonna write to dill in it
42, francis asked what was the use of that
88,well cant you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it
18,itll drive him nuts
99, talking to francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the ocean
43,he was the most boring child i ever met
262,as he lived in mobile he could not inform on me to school authorities but he managed to tell everything he knew to aunt alexandra who in turn unburdened herself to atticus who either forgot it or gave me hell whichever struck his fancy
141,but the only time i ever heard atticus speak sharply to anyone was when i once heard him say sister i do the best i can with them
59, it had something to do with my going around in overalls
56,aunt alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire
175,i could not possibly hope to be a lady if i wore breeches when i said i could do nothing in a dress she said i wasnt supposed to be doing things that required pants
235,aunt alexandras vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves tea sets and wearing the addapearl necklace she gave me when i was born furthermore i should be a ray of sunshine in my fathers lonely life
210,i suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well but aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam that i was born good but had grown progressively worse every year
249,she hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge but when i asked atticus about it he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business he didnt mind me much the way i was
127,at christmas dinner i sat at the little table in the diningroom jem and francis sat with the adults at the dining table
90,aunty had continued to isolate me long after jem and francis graduated to the big table
71,i often wondered what she thought id do get up and throw something
241,i sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once i would prove to her how civilized i could be after all i ate at home every day with no major mishaps
128,when i begged atticus to use his influence he said he had none  we were guests and we sat where she told us to sit
82,he also said aunt alexandra didnt understand girls much shed never had one
217,but her cooking made up for everything three kinds of meat summer vegetables from her pantry shelves peach pickles two kinds of cake and ambrosia constituted a modest christmas dinner
86,afterwards the adults made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition
45,jem lay on the floor and i went to the back yard
66,put on your coat said atticus dreamily so i didnt hear him
44,francis sat beside me on the back steps
29,that was the best yet i said
40,grandmas a wonderful cook said francis
25,shes gonna teach me how
15, boys dont cook
44, i giggled at the thought of jem in an apron
150,grandma says all men should learn to cook that men oughta be careful with their wives and wait on em when they dont feel good said my cousin
35,i dont want dill waitin on me i said
21,id rather wait on him
100,dont say anything about it yet but were gonna get married as soon as were big enough
23,he asked me last summer
15, francis hooted
25,whats the matter with him
34,aint anything the matter with him
81, you mean that little runt grandma says stays with miss rachel every summer
26, thats exactly who i mean
35, i know all about him said francis
14,what about him
71, grandma says he hasnt got a home   has too he lives in meridian
98,   he just gets passed around from relative to relative and miss rachel keeps him every summer
20, francis thats not so
23, francis grinned at me
46,youre mighty dumb sometimes jean louise
38,guess you dont know any better though
18, what do you mean
126, if uncle atticus lets you run around with stray dogs thats his own business like grandma says so it aint your fault
192,i guess it aint your fault if uncle atticus is a niggerlover besides but im here to tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family   francis what the hell do you mean
18, just what i said
164,grandma says its bad enough he lets you all run wild but now hes turned out a niggerlover well never be able to walk the streets of maycomb agin
45,hes ruinin the family thats what hes doin
66, francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen
62,at a safe distance he called hes nothin but a niggerlover
86,i dont know what youre talkin about but you better cut it out this red hot minute
49, i leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk
30,it was easy to collar francis
27,i said take it back quick
52,francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen
11,niggerlover
56,when stalking ones prey it is best to take ones time
68,say nothing and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge
38,francis appeared at the kitchen door
29,you still mad jean louise
21, he asked tentatively
28,nothing to speak of i said
33,francis came out on the catwalk
37,you gonna take it back fra  ancis
35, but i was too quick on the draw
63,francis shot back into the kitchen so i retired to the steps
22,i could wait patiently
87,i had sat there perhaps five minutes when i heard aunt alexandra speak wheres francis
36, hes out yonder in the kitchen
47, he knows hes not supposed to play in there
96, francis came to the door and yelled grandma shes got me in here and she wont let me out
31, what is all this jean louise
33, i looked up at aunt alexandra
55,i havent got him in there aunty i aint holdin him
50, yes she is shouted francis she wont let me out
26, have you all been fussing
52, jean louise got mad at me grandma called francis
25,francis come out of there
73,jean louise if i hear another word out of you ill tell your father
35,did i hear you say hell a while ago
17, i thought i did
30,id better not hear it again
45, aunt alexandra was a backporch listener
77,the moment she was out of sight francis came out head up and grinning
28,dont you fool with me he said
129,he jumped into the yard and kept his distance kicking tufts of grass turning around occasionally to smile at me
55,jem appeared on the porch looked at us and went away
112,francis climbed the mimosa tree came down put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard
49,i asked him who he thought he was uncle jack
83,francis said he reckoned i got told for me to just sit there and leave him alone
28,i aint botherin you i said
195,francis looked at me carefully concluded that i had been sufficiently subdued and crooned softly niggerlover this time i split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth
63,my left impaired i sailed in with my right but not for long
59,uncle jack pinned my arms to my sides and said standstill
136, aunt alexandra ministered to francis wiping his tears away with her handkerchief rubbing his hair patting his cheek
101,atticus jem and uncle jimmy had come to the back porch when francis started yelling
15,who started this
17, said uncle jack
37,francis and i pointed at each other
69,grandma he bawled she called me a whorelady and jumped on me
20, is that true scout
15, said uncle jack
12,i reckon so
81, when uncle jack looked down at me his features were like aunt alexandras
74,you know i told you youd get in trouble if you used words like that
17,i told you didnt i
40, yes sir but well youre in trouble now
155, i was debating whether to stand there or run and tarried in indecision a moment too long i turned to flee but uncle jack was quicker
94,i found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb in the grass
49,ill never speak to you again as long as i live
58,i hate you an despise you an hope you die tomorrow
74, a statement that seemed to encourage uncle jack more than anything
92,i ran to atticus for comfort but he said i had it coming and it was high time we went home
130,i climbed into the back seat of the car without saying goodbye to anyone and at home i ran to my room and slammed the door
58,jem tried to say something nice but i wouldnt let him
155,when i surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks and i was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door
39,i asked who it was uncle jack answered
78, uncle jack said if i talked like that hed lick me again so i was quiet
80,when he entered the room i retreated to a corner and turned my back on him
36,scout he said do you still hate me
16, go on please sir
56, why i didnt think youd hold it against me he said
64,im disappointed in you  you had that coming and you know it
12, didnt either
85, honey you cant go around calling people   you aint fair i said you aint fair
31, uncle jacks eyebrows went up
125, youre real nice uncle jack an i reckon i love you even after what you did but you dont understand children much
60, uncle jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me
58,and why do i not understand children miss jean louise
52,such conduct as yours required little understanding
96,it was obstreperous disorderly and abusive   you gonna give me a chance to tell you
53,i dont mean to sass you im just tryin to tell you
32, uncle jack sat down on the bed
79,his eyebrows came together and he peered up at me from under them
14,proceed he said
19,i took a deep breath
125,well in the first place you never stopped to gimme a chance to tell you my side of it  you just lit right into me
319,when jem an i fuss atticus doesnt ever just listen to jems side of it he hears mine too an in the second place you told me never to use words like that except in exextreme provocation and francis provocated me enough to knock his block off   uncle jack scratched his head
30,what was your side of it scout
74, francis called atticus somethin an i wasnt about to take it off him
25, what did francis call him
15, a niggerlover
199,i aint very sure what it means but the way francis said it  tell you one thing right now uncle jack ill be  i swear before god if ill sit there and let him say somethin about atticus
24, he called atticus that
30, yes sir he did an a lot more
75,said atticusd be the ruination of the family an he let jem an me run wild
71, from the look on uncle jacks face i thought i was in for it again
68,when he said well see about this i knew francis was in for it
38,ive a good mind to go out there tonight
26, please sir just let it go
45, ive no intention of letting it go he said
34,alexandra should know about this
48,the idea of  waitll i get my hands on that boy
52, uncle jack please promise me somethin please sir
46,promise you wont tell atticus about this
155,he  he asked me one time not to let anything i heard about him make me mad an id ruther him think we were fightin about somethin else instead
14,please promise
79, but i dont like francis getting away with something like that   he didnt
35,you reckon you could tie up my hand
21,its still bleedin some
23, of course i will baby
58,i know of no hand i would be more delighted to tie up
22,will you come this way
50, uncle jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom
249,while he cleaned and bandaged my knuckles he entertained me with a tale about a funny nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named hodge and who counted all the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town
19,there now he said
67,youll have a very unladylike scar on your weddingring finger
15, thank you sir
18, whats a whorelady
243, uncle jack plunged into another long tale about an old prime minister who sat in the house of commons and blew feathers in the air and tried to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads
79,i guess he was trying to answer my question but he made no sense whatsoever
187,later when i was supposed to be in bed i went down the hall for a drink of water and heard atticus and uncle jack in the livingroom i shall never marry atticus
23, i might have children
40, atticus said youve a lot to learn jack
56,your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon
62,she said i didnt understand children much and told me why
21,she was quite right
88,atticus she told me how i should have treated her  oh dear im so sorry i romped on her
19, atticus chuckled
42,she earned it so dont feel too remorseful
75, i waited on tenterhooks for uncle jack to tell atticus my side of it
13,but he didnt
90,he simply murmured her use of bathroom invective leaves nothing to the imagination
87,but she doesnt know the meaning of half she says  she asked me what a whorelady was
17, did you tell her
37, no i told her about lord melbourne
64,when a child asks you something answer him for goodness sake
34,but dont make a production of it
123,children are children but they can spot an evasion quicker than adults and evasion simply muddles em
91,no my father mused you had the right answer this afternoon but the wrong reasons
132,bad language is a stage all children go through and it dies with time when they learn theyre not attracting attention with it
16,hotheadedness isnt
113,scouts got to learn to keep her head and learn soon with whats in store for her these next few months
25,shes coming along though
67,jems getting older and she follows his example a good bit now
39,all she needs is assistance sometimes
45, atticus youve never laid a hand on her
14, i admit that
47,so far ive been able to get by with threats
37,jack she minds me as well as she can
55,doesnt come up to scratch half the time but she tries
41, thats not the answer said uncle jack
45,no the answer is she knows i know she tries
32,thats what makes the difference
96,what bothers me is that she and jem will have to absorb some ugly things pretty soon
135,im not worried about jem keeping his head but scout d just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her prides at stake
48, i waited for uncle jack to break his promise
15,he still didnt
35,atticus how bad is this going to be
46,you havent had too much chance to discuss it
25, it couldnt be worse jack
69,the only thing weve got is a black mans word against the ewells
45,the evidence boils down to youdid  ididnt
145,the jury couldnt possibly be expected to take tom robinsons word against the ewells  are you acquainted with the ewells
42, uncle jack said yes he remembered them
73,he described them to atticus but atticus said youre a generation off
38,the present ones are the same though
30, what are you going to do then
120, before im through i intend to jar the jury a bit  i think well have a reasonable chance on appeal though
39,i really cant tell at this stage jack
130,you know id hoped to get through life without a case of this kind but john taylor pointed at me and said youre it
33, let this cup pass from you eh
52,but do you think i could face my children otherwise
203,you know whats going to happen as well as i do jack and i hope and pray i can get jem and scout through it without bitterness and most of all without catching maycombs usual disease
137,why reasonable people go stark raving mad when anything involving a negro comes up is something i dont pretend to understand
99,i just hope that jem and scout come to me for their answers instead of listening to the town
30,i hope they trust me enough
10,jean louise
16, my scalp jumped
35,i stuck my head around the corner
40, i scurried to my room and went to bed
57,uncle jack was a prince of a fellow not to let me down
173,but i never figured out how atticus knew i was listening and it was not until many years later that i realized he wanted me to hear every word he said
72,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  atticus was feeble he was nearly fifty
143,when jem and i asked him why he was so old he said he got started late which we felt reflected upon his abilities and manliness
188,he was much older than the parents of our school contemporaries and there was nothing jem or i could say about him when our classmates said my father jem was football crazy
129,atticus was never too tired to play keepaway but when jem wanted to tackle him atticus would say im too old for that son
28, our father didnt do anything
42,he worked in an office not in a drugstore
198,atticus did not drive a dumptruck for the county he was not the sheriff he did not farm work in a garage or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone
28,besides that he wore glasses
100,he was nearly blind in his left eye and said left eyes were the tribal curse of the finches
101,whenever he wanted to see something well he turned his head and looked from his right eye
139,he did not do the things our schoolmates fathers did he never went hunting he did not play poker or fish or drink or smoke
33,he sat in the livingroom and read
216,with these attributes however he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to that year the school buzzed with talk about him defending tom robinson none of which was complimentary
181,after my bout with cecil jacobs when i committed myself to a policy of cowardice word got around that scout finch wouldnt fight any more her daddy wouldnt let her
105,this was not entirely correct i wouldnt fight publicly for atticus but the family was private ground
67,i would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail
40,francis hancock for example knew that
70,when he gave us our airrifles atticus wouldnt teach us to shoot
90,uncle jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof he said atticus wasnt interested in guns
113,atticus said to jem one day id rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard but i know youll go after birds
100,shoot all the bluejays you want if you can hit em but remember its a sin to kill a mockingbird
122, that was the only time i ever heard atticus say it was a sin to do something and i asked miss maudie about it
25,your fathers right she said
65,mockingbirds dont do one thing but make music for us to enjoy
123,they dont eat up peoples gardens dont nest in corncribs they dont do one thing but sing their hearts out for us
40,thats why its a sin to kill a mockingbird
50, miss maudie this is an old neighborhood aint it
31, been here longer than the town
54, nome i mean the folks on our street are all old
45,jem and mes the only children around here
91,mrs dubose is close on to a hundred and miss rachels old and so are you and atticus
54, i dont call fifty very old said miss maudie tartly
34,not being wheeled around yet am i
20,neither s your father
201,but i must say providence was kind enough to burn down that old mausoleum of mine im too old to keep it up  maybe youre right jean louise this is a settled neighborhood
51,youve never been around young folks much have you
16, yessum at school
23, i mean young grownups
20,youre lucky you know
49,you and jem have the benefit of your fathers age
59,if your father was thirty youd find life quite different
11, i sure would
24,atticus cant do anything
35, youd be surprised said miss maudie
22,theres life in him yet
14, what can he do
76, well he can make somebodys will so airtight cant anybody meddle with it
71, shoot well did you know hes the best checkerplayer in this town
119,why down at the landing when we were coming up atticus finch could beat everybody on both sides of the river
58, good lord miss maudie jem and me beat him all the time
58, its about time you found out its because he lets you
39,did you know he can play a jews harp
80, this modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him
14,well she said
22,well what miss maudie
11, well nothing
53,nothing  it seems with all that youd be proud of him
30,cant everybody play a jews harp
44,now keep out of the way of the carpenters
68,youd better go home ill be in my azaleas and cant watch you
20,plank might hit you
124, i went to the back yard and found jem plugging away at a tin can which seemed stupid with all the bluejays around
289,i returned to the front yard and busied myself for two hours erecting a complicated breastworks at the side of the porch consisting of a tire an orange crate the laundry hamper the porch chairs and a small us flag jem gave me from a popcorn box
95,when atticus came home to dinner he found me crouched down aiming across the street
25,what are you shooting at
23, miss maudie s rear end
71, atticus turned and saw my generous target bending over her bushes
72,he pushed his hat to the back of his head and crossed the street
49,maudie he called i thought id better warn you
30,youre in considerable peril
51, miss maudie straightened up and looked toward me
44,she said atticus you are a devil from hell
49, when atticus returned he told me to break camp
75,dont you ever let me catch you pointing that gun at anybody again he said
40,i wished my father was a devil from hell
42,i sounded out calpurnia on the subject
31,why he can do lots of things
29,calpurnia scratched her head
35,well i dont rightly know she said
188,jem underlined it when he asked atticus if he was going out for the methodists and atticus said hed break his neck if he did he was just too old for that sort of thing
133,the methodists were trying to pay off their church mortgage and had challenged the baptists to a game of touch football
67,everybody in towns father was playing it seemed except atticus
235,jem said he didnt even want to go but he was unable to resist football in any form and he stood gloomily on the sidelines with atticus and me watching cecil jacobss father make touchdowns for the baptists
120,one saturday jem and i decided to go exploring with our airrifles to see if we could find a rabbit or a squirrel
120,we had gone about five hundred yards beyond the radley place when i noticed jem squinting at something down the street
91,he had turned his head to one side and was looking out of the corners of his eyes
19,whatcha looking at
33, that old dog down yonder he said
30,thats old tim johnson aint it
128, tim johnson was the property of mr harry johnson who drove the mobile bus and lived on the southern edge of town
54,tim was a livercolored bird dog the pet of maycomb
14,whats he doing
18, i dont know scout
16,we better go home
21, aw jem its february
31, i dont care im gonna tell cal
41, we raced home and ran to the kitchen
57,cal said jem can you come down the sidewalk a minute
14, what for jem
56,i cant come down the sidewalk every time you want me
56, theres somethin wrong with an old dog down yonder
18, calpurnia sighed
36,i cant wrap up any dogs foot now
65,theres some gauze in the bathroom go get it and do it yourself
20, jem shook his head
11,hes sick cal
25,somethings wrong with him
45, whats he do in trying to catch his tail
24, no hes doin like this
79, jem gulped like a goldfish hunched his shoulders and twitched his torso
47,hes goin like that only not like he means to
34, are you telling me a story jem finch
26, calpurnias voice hardened
22,no cal i swear im not
14, was he runnin
63, no hes just moseyin along so slow you cant hardly tell it
20,hes comin this way
62, calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed jem into the yard
28,i dont see any dog she said
69,she followed us beyond the radley place and looked where jem pointed
89,tim johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance but he was closer to us
79,he walked erratically as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs
47,he reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed
27,hes gone lopsided said jem
69,calpurnia stared then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home
105,she shut the wood door behind us went to the telephone and shouted gimme mr finchs office
12, she shouted
11,this is cal
152,i swear to god theres a mad dog down the street a piece  hes comin this way yes sir hes  mr finch i declare he is  old tim johnson yes sir
93,yes   she hung up and shook her head when we tried to ask her what atticus had said
304,she rattled the telephone hook and said miss eula may  now maam im through talkin to mr finch please dont connect me no more  listen miss eula may can you call miss rachel and miss stephanie crawford and whoever s got a phone on this street and tell em a mad dogs comin
12,please maam
22, calpurnia listened
74,i know its february miss eula may but i know a mad dog when i see one
16,please maam hurry
42, calpurnia asked jem radleys got a phone
35, jem looked in the book and said no
32,they wont come out anyway cal
30, i dont care im gonna tell em
52, she ran to the front porch jem and i at her heels
21,you stay in that house
9, she yelled
59,calpurnias message had been received by the neighborhood
65,every wood door within our range of vision was closed tight
30,we saw no trace of tim johnson
106,we watched calpurnia running toward the radley place holding her skirt and apron above her knees
60,she went up to the front steps and banged on the door
78,she got no answer and she shouted mr nathan mr arthur mad dogs comin
15,mad dogs comin
45, shes supposed to go around in back i said
16,jem shook his head
38,dont make any difference now he said
42,calpurnia pounded on the door in vain
73,no one acknowledged her warning no one seemed to have heard it
81,as calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black ford swung into the driveway
35,atticus and mr heck tate got out
55,mr heck tate was the sheriff of maycomb county
37,he was as tall as atticus but thinner
96,he was longnosed wore boots with shiny metal eyeholes boot pants and a lumber jacket
48,his belt had a row of bullets sticking in it
24,he carried a heavy rifle
63,when he and atticus reached the porch jem opened the door
27,stay inside son said atticus
15,where is he cal
69, he oughta be here by now said calpurnia pointing down the street
16,not runnin is he
14, asked mr tate
38,naw sir hes in the twitchin stage mr
31, should we go after him heck
14, asked atticus
25,we better wait mr finch
61,they usually go in a straight line but you never can tell
87,he might follow the curve  hope he does or hell go straight in the radley back yard
19,lets wait a minute
58, dont think hell get in the radley yard said atticus
16,fence  stop him
29,hell probably follow the road
128, i thought mad dogs foamed at the mouth galloped leaped and lunged at throats and i thought they did it in august
66,had tim johnson behaved thus i would have been less frightened
59,nothing is more deadly than a deserted waiting street
108,the trees were still the mockingbirds were silent the carpenters at miss maudies house had vanished
40,i heard mr tate sniff then blow his nose
50,i saw him shift his gun to the crook of his arm
87,i saw miss stephanie crawfords face framed in the glass window of her front door
45,miss maudie appeared and stood beside her
106,atticus put his foot on the rung of a chair and rubbed his hand slowly down the side of his thigh
23,there he is he said softly
114,tim johnson came into sight walking dazedly in the inner rim of the curve parallel to the radley house
26,look at him whispered jem
44,mr heck said they walked in a straight line
30,he cant even stay in the road
44, he looks more sick than anything i said
64,let anything get in front of him and hell come straight at it
57, mr tate put his hand to his forehead and leaned forward
23,hes got it all right mr
205, tim johnson was advancing at a snails pace but he was not playing or sniffing at foliage he seemed dedicated to one course and motivated by an invisible force that was inching him toward us
142,we could see him shiver like a horse shedding flies his jaw opened and shut he was alist but he was being pulled gradually toward us
39,hes lookin for a place to die said jem
22,mr tate turned around
48,hes far from dead jem he hasnt got started yet
188, tim johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the radley place and what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road he would take
133,he made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the radley gate then he tried to turn around but was having difficulty
38,atticus said hes within range heck
101,you better get him before he goes down the side street  lord knows whos around the corner
13,go inside cal
107, calpurnia opened the screen door latched it behind her then unlatched it and held onto the hook
91,she tried to block jem and me with her body but we looked out from beneath her arms
11,take him mr
66, mr tate handed the rifle to atticus jem and i nearly fainted
35,dont waste time heck said atticus
33, mr finch this is a oneshot job
66, atticus shook his head vehemently dont just stand there heck
81,he wont wait all day for you   for gods sake mr finch look where he is
48,miss and youll go straight into the radley house
37,i cant shoot that well and you know it
84, i havent shot a gun in thirty years   mr tate almost threw the rifle at atticus
51,id feel mighty comfortable if you did now he said
102,in a fog jem and i watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle of the street
117,he walked quickly but i thought he moved like an underwater swimmer time had slowed to a nauseating crawl
116,when atticus raised his glasses calpurnia murmured sweet jesus help him and put her hands to her cheeks
109,atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead they slipped down and he dropped them in the street
35,in the silence i heard them crack
63,atticus rubbed his eyes and chin we saw him blink hard
86,in front of the radley gate tim johnson had made up what was left of his mind
85,he had finally turned himself around to pursue his original course up our street
58,he made two steps forward then stopped and raised his head
24,we saw his body go rigid
139,with movements so swift they seemed simultaneous atticus s hand yanked a ball tipped lever as he brought the gun to his shoulder
17,the rifle cracked
92,tim johnson leaped flopped over and crumpled on the sidewalk in a brownandwhite heap
26,he didnt know what hit him
58,mr tate jumped off the porch and ran to the radley place
123,he stopped in front of the dog squatted turned around and tapped his finger on his forehead above his left eye
51,you were a little to the right mr finch he called
29,always was answered atticus
43,if i had my druthers id take a shotgun
169, he stooped and picked up his glasses ground the broken lenses to powder under his heel and went to mr tate and stood looking down at tim johnson
65,doors opened one by one and the neighborhood slowly came alive
68,miss maudie walked down the steps with miss stephanie crawford
17,jem was paralyzed
101,i pinched him to get him moving but when atticus saw us coming he called stay where you are
70, when mr tate and atticus returned to the yard mr tate was smiling
35,ill have zeebo collect him he said
30,you havent forgot much mr finch
27,they say it never leaves you
19, atticus was silent
26, i saw that oneshot finch
48, atticus wheeled around and faced miss maudie
95,they looked at one another without saying anything and atticus got into the sheriffs car
24,come here he said to jem
42,dont you go near that dog you understand
57,dont go near him hes just as dangerous dead as alive
19, yes sir said jem
17,atticus what son
51, whats the matter with you boy cant you talk
31, said mr tate grinning at jem
77,didnt you know your daddys   hush heck said atticus lets go back to town
69, when they drove away jem and i went to miss stephanies front steps
57,we sat waiting for zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck
116,jem sat in numb confusion and miss stephanie said uh uh uh whoda thought of a mad dog in february
44,maybe he wadnt mad maybe he was just crazy
116,id hate to see harry johnsons face when he gets in from the mobile run and finds atticus finchs shot his dog
241,bet he was just full of fleas from somewhere   miss maudie said miss stephanied be singing a different tune if tim johnson was still coming up the street that theyd find out soon enough theyd send his head to montgomery
53,jem became vaguely articulate d you see him scout
35,d you see him just standin there
94,n all of a sudden he just relaxed all over an it looked like that gun was a part of him
27,an he did it so quick like
88,i hafta aim for ten minutes fore i can hit somethin  miss maudie grinned wickedly
92,well now miss jean louise she said still think your father cant do anything
22,still ashamed of him
20, nome i said meekly
136,forgot to tell you the other day that besides playing the jews harp atticus finch was the deadest shot in maycomb county in his time
11, echoed jem
26,thats what i said jem finch
34,guess youll change your tune now
76,the very idea didnt you know his nickname was  oneshot when he was a boy
147,why down at the landing when he was coming up if he shot fifteen times and hit fourteen doves hed complain about wasting ammunition
51, he never said anything about that jem muttered
37,never said anything about it did he
47, wonder why he never goes huntin now i said
37,maybe i can tell you said miss maudie
53,if your fathers anything hes civilized in his heart
149,marksmanships a gift of god a talent  oh you have to practice to make it perfect but shootins different from playing the piano or the like
134,i think maybe he put his gun down when he realized that god had given him an unfair advantage over most living things
74,i guess he decided he wouldnt shoot till he had to and he had to today
40, looks like hed be proud of it i said
89,people in their right minds never take pride in their talents said miss maudie
22,we saw zeebo drive up
95,he took a pitchfork from the back of the garbage truck and gingerly lifted tim johnson
118,he pitched the dog onto the truck then poured something from a gallon jug on and around the spot where tim fell
49,dont yawl come over here for a while he called
96,when we went home i told jem wed really have something to talk about at school on monday
16,jem turned on me
40,dont say anything about it scout he said
14,i certainly am
59,aint everybodys daddy the deadest shot in maycomb county
66, jem said i reckon if hed wanted us to know it heda told us
35,if he was proud of it hedatoldus
42, maybe it just slipped his mind i said
49,naw scout its something you wouldnt understand
123,atticus is real old but i wouldnt care if he couldnt do anything  i wouldnt care if he couldnt do a blessed thing
69, jem picked up a rock and threw it jubilantly at the carhouse
71,running after it he called back atticus is a gentleman just like me
384, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  when we were small jem and i confined our activities to the southern neighborhood but when i was well into the second grade at school and tormenting boo radley became passe the business section of maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of mrs henry lafayette dubose
111,it was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way
115,previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more but jem said i had to grow up some time
168,mrs dubose lived alone except for a negro girl in constant attendance two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dogtrot hall
92,she was very old she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair
100,it was rumored that she kept a csa pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps
22,jem and i hated her
272,if she was on the porch when we passed we would be raked by her wrathful gaze subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up which was always nothing
185,we had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it
35,we could do nothing to please her
122,if i said as sunnily as i could hey mrs dubose i would receive for an answer dont you say hey to me you ugly girl
28,you say good afternoon mrs
16, she was vicious
88,once she heard jem refer to our father as atticus and her reaction was apoplectic
188,besides being the sassiest most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mothers death
138,a lovelier lady than our mother never lived she said and it was heartbreaking the way atticus finch let her children run wild
157,i did not remember our mother but jem did  he would tell me about her sometimes  and he went livid when mrs dubose shot us this message
285,jem having survived boo radley a mad dog and other terrors had concluded that it was cowardly to stop at miss rachels front steps and wait and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet atticus coming from work
104,countless evenings atticus would find jem furious at something mrs dubose had said when we went by
38,easy does it son atticus would say
85,shes an old lady and shes ill you just hold your head high and be a gentleman
73,whatever she says to you its your job not to let her make you mad
63, jem would say she must not be very sick she hollered so
134,when the three of us came to her house atticus would sweep off his hat wave gallantly to her and say good evening mrs dubose
41,you look like a picture this evening
53, i never heard atticus say like a picture of what
118,he would tell her the courthouse news and would say he hoped with all his heart shed have a good day tomorrow
132,he would return his hat to his head swing me to his shoulders in her very presence and we would go home in the twilight
146,it was times like these when i thought my father who hated guns and had never been to any wars was the bravest man who ever lived
129,the day after jems twelfth birthday his money was burning up his pockets so we headed for town in the early afternoon
111,jem thought he had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me
137,i had long had my eye on that baton it was at v j elmores it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel it cost seventeen cents
105,it was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the maycomb county high school band
213,having developed my talent to where i could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down i had caused calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand
120,i felt that i could overcome this defect with a real baton and i thought it generous of jem to buy one for me
58,mrs dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by
47,where are you two going at this time of day
12, she shouted
25,playing hooky i suppose
44,ill just call up the principal and tell him
80, she put her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face
40,aw its saturday mrs dubose said jem
58,makes no difference if its saturday she said obscurely
47,i wonder if your father knows where you are
78, mrs dubose weve been goin to town by ourselves since we were this high
71, jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the sidewalk
17,dont you lie to me
12, she yelled
88,jeremy finch maudie atkinson told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning
89,shes going to tell your father and then youll wish you never saw the light of day
81,if you arent sent to the reform school before next week my names not dubose
171, jem who hadnt been near miss maudies scuppernong arbor since last summer and who knew miss maudie wouldnt tell atticus if he had issued a general denial
24,dont you contradict me
19, mrs dubose bawled
88,and you   she pointed an arthritic finger at me  what are you doing in those overalls
55,you should be in a dress and camisole young lady
115,youll grow up waiting on tables if somebody doesnt change your ways  a finch waiting on tables at the ok
15, i was terrified
58,cafe was a dim organization on the north side of the square
43,i grabbed jems hand but he shook me loose
26,come on scout he whispered
77,dont pay any attention to her just hold your head high and be a gentleman
106, but mrs dubose held us not only a finch waiting on tables but one in the courthouse lawing for niggers
14, jem stiffened
143,mrs duboses shot had gone home and she knew it yes indeed what has this world come to when a finch goes against his raising
12,ill tell you
29, she put her hand to her mouth
67,when she drew it away it trailed a long silver thread of saliva
63,your fathers no better than the niggers and trash he works for
16, jem was scarlet
297,i pulled at his sleeve and we were followed up the sidewalk by a philippic on our familys moral degeneration the major premise of which was that half the finches were in the asylum anyway but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a state
114,i wasnt sure what jem resented most but i took umbrage at mrs duboses assessment of the familys mental hygiene
77,i had become almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at atticus
47,but this was the first one coming from an adult
81,except for her remarks about atticus mrs duboses attack was only routine
148,there was a hint of summer in the air  in the shadows it was cool but the sun was warm which meant good times coming no school and dill
68,jem bought his steam engine and we went by elmores for my baton
117,jem took no pleasure in his acquisition he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home
78,on the way home i nearly hit mr link deas who said look out now scout
156, when i missed a toss and when we approached mrs duboses house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times
25,she was not on the porch
211,in later years i sometimes wondered exactly what made jem do it what made him break the bonds of you just be a gentleman son and the phase of self conscious rectitude he had recently entered
215,jem had probably stood as much guff about atticus lawing for niggers as had i and i took it for granted that he kept his temper  he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse
127,at the time however i thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad
172,what jem did was something id do as a matter of course had i not been under atticus s interdict which i assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies
326,we had just come to her gate when jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into mrs duboses front yard forgetting everything atticus had said forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls forgetting that if mrs dubose missed her girl jessie probably wouldnt
166,he did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every camellia bush mrs dubose owned until the ground was littered with green buds and leaves
80,he bent my baton against his knee snapped it in two and threw it down
31,by that time i was shrieking
146,jem yanked my hair said he didnt care hed do it again if he got a chance and if i didnt shut up hed pull every hair out of my head
33,i didnt shut up and he kicked me
39,i lost my balance and fell on my face
62,jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry
25,there was nothing to say
59,we did not choose to meet atticus coming home that evening
58,we skulked around the kitchen until calpurnia threw us out
67,by some voodoo system calpurnia seemed to know all about it
156,she was a less than satisfactory source of palliation but she did give jem a hot biscuitandbutter which he tore in half and shared with me
22,it tasted like cotton
28,we went to the livingroom
117,i picked up a football magazine found a picture of dixie howell showed it to jem and said this looks like you
80, that was the nicest thing i could think to say to him but it was no help
78,he sat by the windows hunched down in a rocking chair scowling waiting
14,daylight faded
99,two geological ages later we heard the soles of atticus s shoes scrape the front steps
123,the screen door slammed there was a pause  atticus was at the hat rack in the hall  and we heard him call jem
39, his voice was like the winter wind
100,atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us there frozen still
80,he carried my baton in one hand its filthy yellow tassel trailed on the rug
63,he held out his other hand it contained fat camellia buds
43,jem he said are you responsible for this
11, whydyoudoit
61, jem said softly she said you lawed for niggers and trash
35, you did this because she said that
51, jems lips moved but his yes sir was inaudible
191,son i have no doubt that youve been annoyed by your contemporaries about me lawing for niggers as you say but to do something like this to a sick old lady is inexcusable
83,i strongly advise you to go down and have a talk with mrs dubose said atticus
30,come straight home afterward
17, jem did not move
13,go on i said
39, i followed jem out of the livingroom
37,come back here atticus said to me
11,i came back
86,atticus picked up the mobile press and sat down in the rocking chair jem had vacated
214,for the life of me i did not understand how he could sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an excellent chance of being murdered with a confederate army relic
111,of course jem antagonized me sometimes until i could kill him but when it came down to it he was all i had
71,atticus did not seem to realize this or if he did he didnt care
142,i hated him for that but when you are in trouble you become easily tired soon i was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me
40,youre mighty big to be rocked he said
43,you dont care what happens to him i said
84,you just send him on to get shot at when all he was doin was standin up for you
41, atticus pushed my head under his chin
36,its not time to worry yet he said
103,i never thought jemd be the one to lose his head over this  thought id have more trouble with you
127, i said i didnt see why we had to keep our heads anyway that nobody i knew at school had to keep his head about anything
97,scout said atticus when summer comes youll have to keep your head about far worse things
351,its not fair for you and jem i know that but sometimes we have to make the best of things and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips are down  well all i can say is when you and jem are grown maybe youll look back on this with some compassion and some feeling that i didnt let you down
178,this case tom robinsons case is something that goes to the essence of a mans conscience  scout i couldnt go to church and worship god if i didnt try to help that man
31, atticus you must be wrong
67, well most folks seem to think theyre right and youre wrong
200, theyre certainly entitled to think that and theyre entitled to full respect for their opinions said atticus but before i can live with other folks ive got to live with myself
78,the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience
65, when jem returned he found me still in atticuss lap well son
13, said atticus
71,he set me on my feet and i made a secret reconnaissance of jem
72,he seemed to be all in one piece but he had a queer look on his face
44,perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel
145,i cleaned it up for her and said i was sorry but i aint and that id work on em ever saturday and try to make em grow back out
75, there was no point in saying you were sorry if you arent said atticus
82,jem shes old and ill you cant hold her responsible for what she says and does
113,of course id rather shed have said it to me than to either of you but we cant always have our druthers
49, jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet
49,atticus he said she wants me to read to her
11, read to her
118,she wants me to come every afternoon after school and saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours
19,atticus do i have to
40, but she wants me to do it for a month
29, then youll do it for a month
86, jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and pressed it in
106,finally he said atticus its all right on the sidewalk but inside its  its all dark and creepy
40,theres shadows and things on the ceiling
24, atticus smiled grimly
41,that should appeal to your imagination
44,just pretend youre inside the radley house
137, the following monday afternoon jem and i climbed the steep front steps to mrs duboses house and padded down the open hallway
97,jem armed with ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge knocked at the second door on the left
59,jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door
22,is that you jem finch
29,you got your sister with you
53,i dont know   let em both in jessie said mrs dubose
47,jessie admitted us and went off to the kitchen
211,an oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold an odor i had met many times in rainrotted gray houses where there are coaloil lamps water dippers and unbleached domestic sheets
40,it always made me afraid expectant watchful
81,in the corner of the room was a brass bed and in the bed was mrs dubose
88,i wondered if jems activities had put her there and for a moment i felt sorry for her
70,she was lying under a pile of quilts and looked almost friendly
217,there was a marbletopped washstand by her bed on it were a glass with a teaspoon in it a red ear syringe a box of absorbent cotton and a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs
59,so you brought that dirty little sister of yours did you
18, was her greeting
112,jem said quietly my sister aint dirty and i aint scared of you although i noticed his knees shaking
86,i was expecting a tirade but all she said was you may commence reading jeremy
58, jem sat down in a canebottom chair and opened ivanhoe
42,i pulled up another one and sat beside him
28,come closer said mrs dubose
29,come to the side of the bed
28, we moved our chairs forward
117,this was the nearest i had ever been to her and the thing i wanted most to do was move my chair back again
17,she was horrible
185,her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase and the corners of her mouth glistened with wet which inched like a glacier down the deep grooves enclosing her chin
86,oldage liver spots dotted her cheeks and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils
74,her hands were knobby and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails
162,her bottom plate was not in and her upper lip protruded from time to time she would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it
31,this made the wet move faster
39,i didnt look any more than i had to
41,jem reopened ivanhoe and began reading
52,i tried to keep up with him but he read too fast
122,when jem came to a word he didnt know he skipped it but mrs dubose would catch him and make him spell it out
165,jem read for perhaps twenty minutes during which time i looked at the sootstained mantelpiece out the window anywhere to keep from looking at her
157,as he read along i noticed that mrs dubose s corrections grew fewer and farther between that jem had even left one sentence dangling in midair
22,she was not listening
23,i looked toward the bed
31,something had happened to her
56,she lay on her back with the quilts up to her chin
39,only her head and shoulders were visible
41,her head moved slowly from side to side
107,from time to time she would open her mouth wide and i could see her tongue undulate faintly
97,cords of saliva would collect on her lips she would draw them in then open her mouth again
60,her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own
97,it worked separate and apart from the rest of her out and in like a clam hole at low tide
84,occasionally it would say pt like some viscous substance coming to a boil
22,i pulled jems sleeve
31,he looked at me then at the bed
94,her head made its regular sweep toward us and jem said mrs dubose are you all right
23, she did not hear him
48,the alarm clock went off and scared us stiff
88,a minute later nerves still tingling jem and i were on the sidewalk headed for home
123,we did not run away jessie sent us before the clock wound down she was in the room pushing jem and me out of it
30,shoo she said you all go home
26, jem hesitated at the door
40,its time for her medicine jessie said
92,as the door swung shut behind us i saw jessie walking quickly toward mrs dubose s bed
143,it was only three fortyfive when we got home so jem and i dropkicked in the back yard until it was time to meet atticus
163,atticus had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for jem which i suppose was a silent reward for our first days session with mrs dubose
26,jem told him what happened
19,did she frighten you
15, asked atticus
35,no sir said jem but shes so nasty
25,she has fits or somethin
17,she spits a lot
20, she cant help that
55,when people are sick they dont look nice sometimes
23, she scared me i said
38,atticus looked at me over his glasses
39,you dont have to go with jem you know
391, the next afternoon at mrs dubose s was the same as the first and so was the next until gradually a pattern emerged everything would begin normally  that is mrs dubose would hound jem for a while on her favorite subjects her camellias and our fathers niggerloving propensities she would grow increasingly silent then go away from us
92,the alarm clock would ring jessie would shoo us out and the rest of the day was ours
59,atticus i said one evening what exactly is a niggerlover
25, atticuss face was grave
40,has somebody been calling you that
35, no sir mrs dubose calls you that
49,she warms up every afternoon calling you that
70,francis called me that last christmas thats where i first heard it
39, is that the reason you jumped on him
13, asked atticus
52,yes sir then why are you asking me what it means
134, i tried to explain to atticus that it wasnt so much what francis said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it
44,it was like hed said snotnose or somethin
107, scout said atticus niggerlover is just one of those terms that dont mean anything  like snotnose
140,its hard to explain  ignorant trashy people use it when they think somebodys favoring negroes over and above themselves
117,its slipped into usage with some people like ourselves when they want a common ugly term to label somebody
50, you arent really a niggerlover then are you
16, i certainly am
32,i do my best to love everybody
107,im hard put sometimes  baby its never an insult to be called what somebody thinks is a bad name
64,it just shows you how poor that person is it doesnt hurt you
36,so dont let mrs dubose get you down
35,she has enough troubles of her own
211, one afternoon a month later jem was ploughing his way through sir walter scout as jem called him and mrs dubose was correcting him at every turn when there was a knock on the door
14, she screamed
16,atticus came in
46,he went to the bed and took mrs duboses hand
64,i was coming from the office and didnt see the children he said
36,i thought they might still be here
27, mrs dubose smiled at him
127,for the life of me i could not figure out how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him so
38,do you know what time it is atticus
35,exactly fourteen minutes past five
37,the alarm clocks set for fivethirty
24,i want you to know that
238, it suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little longer at mrs duboses that the alarm clock went off a few minutes later every day and that she was well into one of her fits by the time it sounded
135,today she had antagonized jem for nearly two hours with no intention of having a fit and i felt hopelessly trapped
96,the alarm clock was the signal for our release if one day it did not ring what would we do
72,i have a feeling that jems reading days are numbered said atticus
56,only a week longer i think she said just to make sure
49,but atticus put out his hand and jem was silent
109,on the way home jem said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasnt fair
39,just one more week son said atticus
11,no said jem
17,yes said atticus
46,the following week found us back at mrs duboses
195,the alarm clock had ceased sounding but mrs dubose would release us with thatll do so late in the afternoon atticus would be home reading the paper when we returned
317,although her fits had passed off she was in every other way her old self when sir walter scott became involved in lengthy descriptions of moats and castles mrs dubose would become bored and pick on us jeremy finch i told you youd live to regret tearing up my camellias
28,you regret it now dont you
33, jem would say he certainly did
57,thought you could kill my snowonthe mountain did you
46,well jessie says the tops growing back out
53,next time youll know how to do it right wont you
42,youll pull it up by the roots wont you
33, jem would say he certainly would
24,dont you mutter at me boy
38,you hold up your head and say yes maam
80,dont guess you feel like holding it up though with your father what he is
93, jems chin would come up and he would gaze at mrs dubose with a face devoid of resentment
183,through the weeks he had cultivated an expression of polite and detached interest which he would present to her in answer to her most blood curdling inventions
20,at last the day came
73,when mrs dubose said thatll do one afternoon she added and thats all
15,goodday to you
12, it was over
80,we bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief leaping and howling
92,that spring was a good one the days grew longer and gave us more playing time
114,jems mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics of every college football player in the nation
72,every night atticus would read us the sports pages of the newspapers
132,alabama might go to the rose bowl again this year judging from its prospects not one of whose names we could pronounce
93,atticus was in the middle of windy seatons column one evening when the telephone rang
55,he answered it then went to the hat rack in the hall
55,im going down to mrs duboses for a while he said
15,i wont be long
52, but atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime
49,when he returned he was carrying a candy box
98,atticus sat down in the livingroom and put the box on the floor beside his chair
15,whatd she want
46,we had not seen mrs dubose for over a month
51,she was never on the porch any more when we passed
28,shes dead son said atticus
27,she died a few minutes ago
12, oh said jem
28, well is right said atticus
28,shes not suffering any more
30,she was sick for a long time
37,son didnt you know what her fits were
21, jem shook his head
53,mrs dubose was a morphine addict said atticus
40,she took it as a painkiller for years
23,the doctor put her on it
113,shed have spent the rest of her life on it and died without so much agony but she was too contrary   sir
77,atticus said just before your escapade she called me to make her will
57,dr reynolds told her she had only a few months left
104,her business affairs were in perfect order but she said theres still one thing out of order
14, what was that
20, jem was perplexed
78,she said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and nobody
115,jem when youre sick as she was its all right to take anything to make it easier but it wasnt all right for her
87,she said she meant to break herself of it before she died and thats what she did
47, jem said you mean thats what her fits were
27, yes thats what they were
84,most of the time you were reading to her i doubt if she heard a word you said
64,her whole mind and body were concentrated on that alarm clock
77,if you hadnt fallen into her hands id have made you go read to her anyway
34,it may have been some distraction
43,there was another reason   did she die free
38,as the mountain air said atticus
39,she was conscious to the last almost
37,conscious he smiled and cantankerous
126,she still disapproved heartily of my doings and said id probably spend the rest of my life bailing you out of jail
94,she had jessie fix you this box   atticus reached down and picked up the candy box
19,he handed it to jem
18,jem opened the box
74,inside surrounded by wads of damp cotton was a white waxy perfect camellia
30,it was a snowonthemountain
41,jems eyes nearly popped out of his head
30,old helldevil old helldevil
28, he screamed flinging it down
29,why cant she leave me alone
49, in a flash atticus was up and standing over him
48,jem buried his face in atticuss shirt front
11,shh he said
106,i think that was her way of telling you  everythings all right now jem everythings all right
31,you know she was a great lady
19, jem raised his head
21,his face was scarlet
50,after all those things she said about you a lady
72,she had her own views about things a lot different from mine maybe
87,son i told you that if you hadnt lost your head id have made you go read to her
184,i wanted you to see something about her  i wanted you to see what real courage is instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand
115,its when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what
35,you rarely win but sometimes you do
50,mrs dubose won all ninetyeight pounds of her
66,according to her views she died beholden to nothing and nobody
42,she was the bravest person i ever knew
63, jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire
93,he picked up the camellia and when i went off to bed i saw him fingering the wide petals
32,atticus was reading the paper
63,part two contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem was twelve
49,he was difficult to live with inconsistent moody
144,his appetite was appalling and he told me so many times to stop pestering him i consulted atticus reckon hes got a tapeworm
33, atticus said no jem was growing
70,i must be patient with him and disturb him as little as possible
60,this change in jem had come about in a matter of weeks
123,mrs dubose was not cold in her grave  jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he went to read to her
184,overnight it seemed jem had acquired an alien set of values and was trying to impose them on me several times he went so far as to tell me what to do
93,after one altercation when jem hollered its time you started bein a girl and acting right
44, i burst into tears and fled to calpurnia
51,dont you fret too much over mister jem   she began
33, yeah hes just about mister jem now
25, he aint that old i said
75,all he needs is somebody to beat him up and i aint big enough
71, baby said calpurnia i just cant help it if mister jems growin up
145,hes gonna want to be off to himself a lot now doin whatever boys do so you just come right on in the kitchen when you feel lonesome
40,well find lots of things to do in here
112, the beginning of that summer boded well jem could do as he pleased calpurnia would do until dill came
157,she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl
41,but summer came and dill was not there
42,i received a letter and a snapshot from him
170,the letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed and he would have to stay in meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat
54,his father was a lawyer like atticus only much younger
104,dills new father had a pleasant face which made me glad dill had captured him but i was crushed
176,dill concluded by saying he would love me forever and not to worry he would come get me and marry me as soon as he got enough money together so please write
414,the fact that i had a permanent fiance was little compensation for his absence i had never thought about it but summer was dill by the fishpool smoking string dills eyes alive with complicated plans to make boo radley emerge summer was the swiftness with which dill would reach up and kiss me when jem was not looking the longings we sometimes felt each other feel
64,with him life was routine without him life was unbearable
33,i stayed miserable for two days
129,as if that were not enough the state legislature was called into emergency session and atticus left us for two weeks
202,the governor was eager to scrape a few barnacles off the ship of state there were sitdown strikes in birmingham bread lines in the cities grew longer people in the country grew poorer
62,but these were events remote from the world of jem and me
123,we were surprised one morning to see a cartoon in the montgomery advertiser above the caption maycombs finch
175, it showed atticus barefooted and in short pants chained to a desk he was diligently writing on a slate while some frivolous looking girls yelled yoohoo
33,thats a compliment explained jem
77,he spends his time doin things that wouldnt get done if nobody did em
105, in addition to jems newly developed characteristics he had acquired a maddening air of wisdom
77,oh scout its like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things
44,that kind of things pretty dry to most men
16, how do you know
28, oh go on and leave me alone
20,im readin the paper
18, jem got his wish
25,i departed for the kitchen
112,while she was shelling peas calpurnia suddenly said what am i gonna do about you alls church this sunday
17, nothing i reckon
27,atticus left us collection
89, calpurnia s eyes narrowed and i could tell what was going through her mind
34,cal i said you know well behave
47,we havent done anything in church in years
95, calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy sunday when we were both fatherless and teacherless
115,left to its own devices the class tied eunice ann simpson to a chair and placed her in the furnace room
390,we forgot her trooped upstairs to church and were listening quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued from the radiator pipes persisting until someone investigated and brought forth eunice ann saying she didnt want to play shadrach any more  jem finch said she wouldnt get burnt if she had enough faith but it was hot down there
72,besides cal this isnt the first time atticus has left us i protested
60,yeah but he makes certain your teachers gonna be there
55,i didnt hear him say this time  reckon he forgot it
29, calpurnia scratched her head
20,suddenly she smiled
69,howd you and mister jem like to come to church with me tomorrow
12, how bout it
18, grinned calpurnia
136,if calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before it was nothing compared to her supervision of that saturday nights routine
167,she made me soap all over twice drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse she stuck my head in the basin and washed it with octagon soap and castile
178,she had trusted jem for years but that night she invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst cant anybody take a bath in this house without the whole family lookin
70, next morning she began earlier than usual to go over our clothes
153, when calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen that morning it was covered with our sunday habiliments
87,she had put so much starch in my dress it came up like a tent when i sat down
89,she made me wear a petticoat and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist
100,she went over my patent leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them
48,its like we were goin to mardi gras said jem
23,whats all this for cal
84, i dont want anybody sayin i dont look after my children she muttered
64,mister jem you absolutely cant wear that tie with that suit
17, smarter with that
11, suits blue
14,cant you tell
35, hee hee i howled jems color blind
71, his face flushed angrily but calpurnia said now you all quit that
63,youre gonna go to first purchase with smiles on your faces
31, first purchase african me
92,church was in the quarters outside the southern town limits across the old sawmill tracks
203,it was an ancient paintpeeled frame building the only church in maycomb with a steeple and bell called first purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves
78,negroes worshiped in it on sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays
67,the churchyard was brickhard clay as was the cemetery beside it
113,if someone died during a dry spell the body was covered with chunks of ice until rain softened the earth
168,a few graves in the cemetery were marked with crumbling tombstones newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken cocacola bottles
148,lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested uneasily stumps of burnedout candles stood at the heads of infant graves
25,it was a happy cemetery
214,the warm bittersweet smell of clean negro welcomed us as we entered the churchyard  hearts of love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida snuff hoyts cologne browns mule peppermint and lilac talcum
202,when they saw jem and me with calpurnia the men stepped back and took off their hats the women crossed their arms at their waists weekday gestures of respectful attention
68,they parted and made a small pathway to the church door for us
103,calpurnia walked between jem and me responding to the greetings of her brightly clad neighbors
23,what you up to miss cal
24, said a voice behind us
144,calpurnia s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around standing in the path behind us was a tall negro woman
121,her weight was on one leg she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip pointing at us with upturned palm
97,she was bulletheaded with strange almondshaped eyes straight nose and an indianbow mouth
28,she seemed seven feet high
46,i felt calpurnia s hand dig into my shoulder
18,what you want lula
48, she asked in tones i had never heard her use
34,she spoke quietly contemptuously
68,i wants to know why you bringin white chillun to nigger church
33, theys my compny said calpurnia
77,again i thought her voice strange she was talking like the rest of them
63,yeah an i reckon yous compny at the finch house durin the week
32, a murmur ran through the crowd
90,dont you fret calpurnia whispered to me but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly
81,when lula came up the pathway toward us calpurnia said stop right there nigger
126, lula stopped but she said you aint got no business bringin white chillun here  they got their church we got ourn
33,it is our church aint it miss cal
41, calpurnia said its the same god aint it
97, jem said lets go home cal they dont want us here   i agreed they did not want us here
58,i sensed rather than saw that we were being advanced upon
118,they seemed to be drawing closer to us but when i looked up at calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes
51,when i looked down the pathway again lula was gone
51,in her place was a solid mass of colored people
34,one of them stepped from the crowd
36,it was zeebo the garbage collector
60,mister jem he said were mighty glad to have you all here
105,dont pay no tention to lula shes contentious because reverend sykes threatened to church her
117,shes a troublemaker from way back got fancy ideas an haughty ways  were mighty glad to have you all
126, with that calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by reverend sykes who led us to the front pew
54,first purchase was unceiled and unpainted within
108,along its walls unlighted kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets pine benches served as pews
181,behind the rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed god is love the churchs only decoration except a rotogravure print of hunts the light of the world
137,there was no sign of piano organ hymnbooks church programs  the familiar ecclesiastical impedimenta we saw every sunday
93,it was dim inside with a damp coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation
150,at each seat was a cheap cardboard fan bearing a garish garden of gethsemane courtesy tyndals hardware co younameitwe sellit
89,calpurnia motioned jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between us
107,she fished in her purse drew out her handkerchief and untied the hard wad of change in its corner
42,she gave a dime to me and a dime to jem
27,weve got ours he whispered
46,you keep it calpurnia said youre my company
157, jems face showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime but his innate courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket
31,i did likewise with no qualms
42,cal i whispered where are the hymnbooks
28, we dont have any she said
13, shh she said
86,reverend sykes was standing behind the pulpit staring the congregation to silence
156,he was a short stocky man in a black suit black tie white shirt and a gold watchchain that glinted in the light from the frosted windows
102,he said brethren and sisters we are particularly glad to have company with us this morning
22,mister and miss finch
26,you all know their father
49,before i begin i will read some announcements
85, reverend sykes shuffled some papers chose one and held it at arms length
87,the missionary society meets in the home of sister annette reeves next tuesday
16,bring your sewing
30, he read from another paper
47,you all know of brother tom robinsons trouble
73,he has been a faithful member of first purchase since he was a boy
131,the collection taken up today and for the next three sundays will go to helen  his wife to help her out at home
15, i punched jem
32,thats the tom atticuss de   shh
69, i turned to calpurnia but was hushed before i opened my mouth
106,subdued i fixed my attention upon reverend sykes who seemed to be waiting for me to settle down
68,will the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn he said
116,zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle stopping in front of us and facing the congregation
36,he was carrying a battered hymnbook
68,he opened it and said well sing number two seventythree
26, this was too much for me
53,howre we gonna sing it if there aint any hymn books
15, calpurnia smiled
52,hush baby she whispered youll see in a minute
127, zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery theres a land beyond the river
69, miraculously on pitch a hundred voices sang out zeebo s words
108,the last syllable held to a husky hum was followed by zeebo saying that we call the sweet forever
140, music again swelled around us the last note lingered and zeebo met it with the next line and we only reach that shore by faiths decree
87, the congregation hesitated zeebo repeated the line carefully and it was sung
99,at the chorus zeebo closed the book a signal for the congregation to proceed without his help
108,on the dying notes of jubilee zeebo said in that faroff sweet forever just beyond the shining river
109, line for line voices followed in simple harmony until the hymn ended in a melancholy murmur
74,i looked at jem who was looking at zeebo from the corners of his eyes
55,i didnt believe it either but we had both heard it
224,reverend sykes then called on the lord to bless the sick and the suffering a procedure no different from our church practice except reverend sykes directed the deitys attention to several specific cases
211,his sermon was a forthright denunciation of sin an austere declaration of the motto on the wall behind him he warned his flock against the evils of heady brews gambling and strange women
76,bootleggers caused enough trouble in the quarters but women were worse
150,again as i had often met it in my own church i was confronted with the impurity of women doctrine that seemed to preoccupy all clergymen
85,jem and i had heard the same sermon sunday after sunday with only one exception
374,reverend sykes used his pulpit more freely to express his views on individual lapses from grace jim hardy had been absent from church for five sundays and he wasnt sick constance jackson had better watch her ways  she was in grave danger for quarreling with her neighbors she had erected the only spite fence in the history of the quarters
36,reverend sykes closed his sermon
134,he stood beside a table in front of the pulpit and requested the morning offering a proceeding that was strange to jem and me
114,one by one the congregation came forward and dropped nickels and dimes into a black enameled coffee can
91,jem and i followed suit and received a soft thank you thank you as our dimes clinked
106,to our amazement reverend sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the coins into his hand
79,he straightened up and said this is not enough we must have ten dollars
27, the congregation stirred
97,you all know what its for  helen cant leave those children to work while toms in jail
145,if everybody gives one more dime well have it   reverend sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of the church
19,alec shut the doors
45,nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars
84, calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin purse
78,naw cal jem whispered when she handed him a shiny quarter we can put ours in
23,gimme your dime scout
140, the church was becoming stuffy and it occurred to me that reverend sykes intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock
65,fans crackled feet shuffled tobaccochewers were in agony
106,reverend sykes startled me by saying sternly carlow richardson i havent seen you up this aisle yet
68, a thin man in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin
34,the congregation murmured approval
121,reverend sykes then said i want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice and give one more dime apiece
19,then well have it
49, slowly painfully the ten dollars was collected
58,the door was opened and the gust of warm air revived us
65,zeebo lined on jordans stormy banks and church was over
91,i wanted to stay and explore but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of her
124,at the church door while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family jem and i chatted with reverend sykes
90,i was bursting with questions but decided i would wait and let calpurnia answer them
68,we were specially glad to have you all here said reverend sykes
49,this church has no better friend than your daddy
83, my curiosity burst why were you all takin up collection for tom robinsons wife
19, didnt you hear why
22, asked reverend sykes
108,helens got three littleuns and she cant go out to work   why cant she take em with her reverend
209,it was customary for field negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while their parents worked  usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of cotton
116,those unable to sit were strapped papoosestyle on their mothers backs or resided in extra cotton bags
25,reverend sykes hesitated
103,to tell you the truth miss jean louise helens finding it hard to get work these days
51,when its picking time i think mr link deasu take her
17, why not reverend
69, before he could answer i felt calpurnias hand on my shoulder
58,at its pressure i said we thank you for lettin us come
49, jem echoed me and we made our way homeward
94,cal i know tom robinsons in jail an hes done somethin awful but why wont folks hire helen
83,calpurnia in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat walked between jem and me
51,its because of what folks say toms done she said
75,folks arent anxious to  to have anything to do with any of his family
25, just what did he do cal
18, calpurnia sighed
94,old mr bob ewell accused him of rapin his girl an had him arrested an put in jail   mr
17, my memory stirred
107,does he have anything to do with those ewells that come every first day of school an then go home
126,why atticus said they were absolute trash  i never heard atticus talk about folks the way he talked about the ewells
32,he said yeah those are the ones
111, well if everybody in maycomb knows what kind of folks the ewells are theyd be glad to hire helen
14,whats rape cal
58, its somethin youll have to ask mr finch about she said
38,he can explain it better than i can
14,you all hungry
87,the reverend took a long time unwindin this morning hes not usually so tedious
84, hes just like our preacher said jem but why do you all sing hymns that way
19,is that what it is
24, yeah its called linin
47,theyve done it that way as long as i can remember
106, jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get some hymnbooks
17,calpurnia laughed
30,wouldnt do any good she said
15,they cant read
16,all those folks
31, thats right calpurnia nodded
49,cant but about four folks in first purchase read
12,im one of em
30, whered you go to school cal
37,lets see now who taught me my letters
74,it was miss maudie atkinsons aunt old miss buford   are you that old
30, im older than mr finch even
19, calpurnia grinned
25,not sure how much though
235,we started rememberin one time trying to figure out how old i was  i can remember back just a few years moren he can so im not much older when you take off the fact that men cant remember as well as women
24, whats your birthday cal
94, i just have it on christmas its easier to remember that way  i dont have a real birthday
75, but cal jem protested you dont look even near as old as atticus
55, colored folks dont show their ages so fast she said
31,maybe because they cant read
25,cal did you teach zeebo
15, yeah mister jem
48,there wasnt a school even when he was a boy
23,i made him learn though
33, zeebo was calpurnia s eldest son
180,if i had ever thought about it i would have known that calpurnia was of mature years  zeebo had halfgrown children  but then i had never thought about it
44,did you teach him out of a primer like us
158,no i made him get a page of the bible every day and there was a book miss buford taught me out of  bet you dont know where i got it she said
13,we didnt know
58,calpurnia said your granddaddy finch gave it to me
27, were you from the landing
22,you never told us that
26, i certainly am mister jem
65,grew up down there between the buford place and the landin
129,ive spent all my days workin for the finches or the bufords an i moved to maycomb when your daddy and your mamma married
23, what was the book cal
26,blackstones commentaries
22, jem was thunderstruck
39,you mean you taught zeebo outa that
24, why yes sir mister jem
47, calpurnia timidly put her fingers to her mouth
31,they were the only books i had
129,your grandaddy said mr blackstone wrote fine english   thats why you dont talk like the rest of em said jem
13,the rest of who
27, rest of the colored folks
47,cal but you talked like they did in church
65, that calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me
151,the idea that she had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one to say nothing of her having command of two languages
94,cal i asked why do you talk nigger talk to the  to your folks when you know its not right
118, well in the first place im black that doesnt mean you hafta talk that way when you know better said jem
105,calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head then pressed her hat down carefully over her ears
32,its right hard to say she said
97,suppose you and scout talked colored folks talk at home itd be out of place wouldnt it
76,now what if i talked whitefolks talk at church and with my neighbors
46,theyd think i was puttin on airs to beat moses
32, but cal you know better i said
41,its not necessary to tell all you know
113,its not ladylike  in the second place folks dont like to have somebody around knowin more than they do
16,it aggravates em
235,youre not gonna change any of them by talkin right theyve got to want to learn themselves and when they dont want to learn theres nothing you can do but keep your mouth shut or talk their language
39, cal can i come to see you sometimes
23, she looked down at me
11,see me honey
22,you see me every day
25, out to your house i said
19,sometimes after work
18,atticus can get me
30, any time you want to she said
25,wed be glad to have you
46, we were on the sidewalk by the radley place
35,look on the porch yonder jem said
117,i looked over to the radley place expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing
18,the swing was empty
26,i mean our porch said jem
28,i looked down the street
150,enarmored upright uncompromising aunt alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life
125,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  put my bag in the front bedroom calpurnia was the first thing aunt alexandra said
69,jean louise stop scratching your head was the second thing she said
64,calpurnia picked up auntys heavy suitcase and opened the door
34,ill take it said jem and took it
61,i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump
47,the sound had a dull permanence about it
32,have you come for a visit aunty
84,aunt alexandras visits from the landing were rare and she traveled in state
176,she owned a bright green square buick and a black chauffeur both kept in an unhealthy state of tidiness but today they were nowhere to be seen
27,didnt your father tell you
25,jem and i shook our heads
19,probably he forgot
21,hes not in yet is he
69, nome he doesnt usually get back till late afternoon said jem
85,well your father and i decided it was time i came to stay with you for a while
78, for a while in maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty years
29,jem and i exchanged glances
55,jems growing up now and you are too she said to me
78,we decided that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence
318,it wont be many years jean louise before you become interested in clothes and boys   i could have made several answers to this cals a girl it would be many years before i would be interested in boys i would never be interested in clothes
15,but i kept quiet
22,what about uncle jimmy
16,is he comin too
37, oh no hes staying at the landing
26,hell keep the place going
41, the moment i said wont you miss him
49, i realized that this was not a tactful question
97,uncle jimmy present or uncle jimmy absent made not much difference he never said anything
35,aunt alexandra ignored my question
46,i could think of nothing else to say to her
149,in fact i could never think of anything to say to her and i sat thinking of past painful conversations between us how are you jean louise
32,fine thank you maam how are you
61,very well thank you what have you been doing with yourself
22,dont you do anything
26,certainly you have friends
23,well what do you all do
127,it was plain that aunty thought me dull in the extreme because i once heard her tell atticus that i was sluggish
86,there was a story behind all this but i had no desire to extract it from her then
84,today was sunday and aunt alexandra was positively irritable on the lords day
33,i guess it was her sunday corset
243,she was not fat but solid and she chose protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights pinched in her waist flared out her rear and managed to suggest that aunt alexandras was once an hourglass figure
34,from any angle it was formidable
174,the remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when relatives appear but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway
38,it was atticus home from montgomery
53,jem forgetting his dignity ran with me to meet him
125,jem seized his briefcase and bag i jumped into his arms felt his vague dry kiss and said d you bring me a book
23,d you know auntys here
54, atticus answered both questions in the affirmative
44,howd you like for her to come live with us
153, i said i would like it very much which was a lie but one must lie under certain circumstances and at all times when one cant do anything about them
87,we felt it was time you children needed  well its like this scout atticus said
50,your aunts doing me a favor as well as you all
78,i cant stay here all day with you and the summers going to be a hot one
51, yes sir i said not understanding a word he said
114,i had an idea however that aunt alexandras appearance on the scene was not so much atticuss doing as hers
125,aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family and i suppose her coming to live with us was in that category
21,maycomb welcomed her
250,miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded with shinny it made me tight miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt alexandra consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying uh uh uh
196, miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons and mr nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her
128,when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace aunt alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us
294,her missionary society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess she did not permit calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club
300,to all parties present and participating in the life of the county aunt alexandra was one of the last of her kind she had riverboat boardingschool manners let any moral come along and she would uphold it she was born in the objective case she was an incurable gossip
115,when aunt alexandra went to school selfdoubt could not be found in any textbook so she knew not its meaning
148,she was never bored and given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative she would arrange advise caution and warn
285,she never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own a habit that amused jem rather than annoyed him aunty better watch how she talks  scratch most folks in maycomb and theyre kin to us
140, aunt alexandra in underlining the moral of young sam merriweathers suicide said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family
140,let a sixteenyearold girl giggle in the choir and aunty would say it just goes to show you all the penfield women are flighty
114, everybody in maycomb it seemed had a streak a drinking streak a gambling streak a mean streak a funny streak
273,once when aunty assured us that miss stephanie crawfords tendency to mind other peoples business was hereditary atticus said sister when you stop to think about it our generations practically the first in the finch family not to marry its cousins
55,would you say the finches have an incestuous streak
65, aunty said no thats where we got our small hands and feet
52,i never understood her preoccupation with heredity
279,somewhere i had received the impression that fine folks were people who did the best they could with the sense they had but aunt alexandra was of the opinion obliquely expressed that the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was
49,that makes the ewells fine folks then said jem
204,the tribe of which burris ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the maycomb dump and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations
56,aunt alexandras theory had something behind it though
29,maycomb was an ancient town
89,it was twenty miles east of finchs landing awkwardly inland for such an old town
220,but maycomb would have been closer to the river had it not been for the nimble wittedness of one sinkfield who in the dawn of history operated an inn where two pigtrails met the only tavern in the territory
227,sinkfield no patriot served and supplied ammunition to indians and settlers alike neither knowing or caring whether he was a part of the alabama territory or the creek nation so long as business was good
263,business was excellent when governor william wyatt bibb with a view to promoting the newly created countys domestic tranquility dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center and there establish its seat of government
198,the surveyors sinkfields guests told their host that he was in the territorial confines of maycomb county and showed him the probable spot where the county seat would be built
159,had not sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his holdings maycomb would have sat in the middle of winston swamp a place totally devoid of interest
323,instead maycomb grew and sprawled out from its hub sinkfields tavern because sinkfield reduced his guests to myopic drunkenness one evening induced them to bring forward their maps and charts lop off a little here add a bit there and adjust the center of the county to meet his requirements
156,he sent them packing next day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their saddlebags  two apiece and one for the governor
149,because its primary reason for existence was government maycomb was spared the grubbiness that distinguished most alabama towns its size
97,in the beginning its buildings were solid its courthouse proud its streets graciously wide
202,maycomb s proportion of professional people ran high one went there to have his teeth pulled his wagon fixed his heart listened to his money deposited his soul saved his mules vetted
75,but the ultimate wisdom of sinkfields maneuver is open to question
245,he placed the young town too far away from the only kind of public transportation in those days  riverboat  and it took a man from the north end of the county two days to travel to maycomb for store bought goods
134,as a result the town remained the same size for a hundred years an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and timberland
142,although maycomb was ignored during the war between the states reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow
14,it grew inward
148,new people so rarely settled there the same families married the same families until the members of the community looked faintly alike
166,occasionally someone would return from montgomery or mobile with an outsider but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of family resemblance
61,things were more or less the same during my early years
389,there was indeed a caste system in maycomb but to my mind it worked this way the older citizens the present generation of people who had lived side by side for years and years were utterly predictable to one another they took for granted attitudes character shadings even gestures as having been repeated in each generation and refined by time
512,thus the dicta no crawford minds his own business every third merriweather is morbid the truth is not in the delafields all the bufords walk like that were simply guides to daily living never take a check from a delafield without a discreet call to the bank miss maudie atkinsons shoulder stoops because she was a buford if mrs grace merriweather sips gin out of lydia e pinkham bottles its nothing unusual  her mother did the same
118,aunt alexandra fitted into the world of maycomb like a hand into a glove but never into the world of jem and me
192,i so often wondered how she could be atticuss and uncle jacks sister that i revived halfremembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that jem had spun long ago
189,these were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay as she had little to say to jem or me and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went to bed
38,it was summer and we were outdoors
234,of course some afternoons when i would run inside for a drink of water i would find the livingroom overrun with maycomb ladies sipping whispering fanning and i would be called jean louise come speak to these ladies
140, when i appeared in the doorway aunty would look as if she regretted her request i was usually mudsplashed or covered with sand
90,speak to your cousin lily she said one afternoon when she had trapped me in the hall
49,your cousin lily brooke said aunt alexandra
15,she our cousin
19,i didnt know that
124, aunt alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to cousin lily and firm disapproval to me
59,when cousin lily brooke left i knew i was in for it
137,it was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the finch family or to install any pride into his children
56,she summoned jem who sat warily on the sofa beside me
131,she left the room and returned with a purplecovered book on which meditations of joshua s st clair was stamped in gold
45,your cousin wrote this said aunt alexandra
27,he was a beautiful character
31, jem examined the small volume
60,is this the cousin joshua who was locked up for so long
45, aunt alexandra said how did you know that
60, why atticus said he went round the bend at the university
39,said he tried to shoot the president
162,said cousin joshua said he wasnt anything but a sewer inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol only it just blew up in his hand
137,atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one aunt alexandra was standing stiff as a stork
20,thats all she said
19,well see about this
98, before bedtime i was in jems room trying to borrow a book when atticus knocked and entered
73,he sat on the side of jems bed looked at us soberly then he grinned
17, er  hrm he said
149,he was beginning to preface some things he said with a throaty noise and i thought he must at last be getting old but he looked the same
44,i dont exactly know how to say this he began
26,well just say it said jem
23,have we done something
36, our father was actually fidgeting
75,no i just want to explain to you that  your aunt alexandra asked me
37,son you know youre a finch dont you
27, thats what ive been told
49, jem looked out of the corners of his eyes
56,his voice rose uncontrollably atticus whats the matter
52, atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms
41,im trying to tell you the facts of life
23, jems disgust deepened
29,i know all that stuff he said
32,atticus suddenly grew serious
316,in his lawyers voice without a shade of inflection he said your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon you and jean louise that you are not from runofthemill people that you are the product of several generations gentle breeding   atticus paused watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg
266,gentle breeding he continued when i had found and scratched it and that you should try to live up to your name   atticus persevered in spite of us she asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the little lady and gentleman that you are
231,she wants to talk to you about the family and what its meant to maycomb county through the years so youll have some idea of who you are so you might be moved to behave accordingly he concluded at a gallop
96,stunned jem and i looked at each other then at atticus whose collar seemed to worry him
23,we did not speak to him
88,presently i picked up a comb from jems dresser and ran its teeth along the edge
30,stop that noise atticus said
21,his curtness stung me
61,the comb was midway in its journey and i banged it down
73,for no reason i felt myself beginning to cry but i could not stop
24,this was not my father
38,my father never thought these thoughts
24,my father never spoke so
47,aunt alexandra had put him up to this somehow
104,through my tears i saw jem standing in a similar pool of isolation his head cocked to one side
77,there was nowhere to go but i turned to go and met atticuss vest front
224,i buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the light blue cloth his watch ticking the faint crackle of his starched shirt the soft sound of his breathing
31,your stomachs growling i said
19,i know it he said
27,you better take some soda
13, i will he said
68,atticus is all this behavin an stuff gonna make things different
14,i mean are you 
41, i felt his hand on the back of my head
41,dont you worry about anything he said
21,its not time to worry
55, when i heard that i knew he had come back to us
66,the blood in my legs began to flow again and i raised my head
31,you really want us to do all that
59,i cant remember everything finches are supposed to do
29, i dont want you to remember it
76, he went to the door and out of the room shutting the door behind him
85,he nearly slammed it but caught himself at the last minute and closed it softly
76,as jem and i stared the door opened again and atticus peered around
51,his eyebrows were raised his glasses had slipped
45,get more like cousin joshua every day dont i
69,do you think ill end up costing the family five hundred dollars
67, i know now what he was trying to do but atticus was only a man
43,it takes a woman to do that kind of work
140,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  although we heard no more about the finch family from aunt alexandra we heard plenty from the town
289,on saturdays armed with our nickels when jem permitted me to accompany him he was now positively allergic to my presence when in public we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds and sometimes hear theres his chillun or yonders some finches
133, turning to face our accusers we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema bags in the mayco drugstore window
72,or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats sitting in a hoover cart
185,they cn go loose and rape up the countryside for all of em who run this county care was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman when he passed us
61,which reminded me that i had a question to ask atticus
24, i asked him that night
46,atticus looked around from behind his paper
29,he was in his chair by the window
111,as we grew older jem and i thought it generous to allow atticus thirty minutes to himself after supper
94,he sighed and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without consent
89,well if thats all it is why did calpurnia dry me up when i asked her what it was
25, atticus looked pensive
14,whats that again
131, well i asked calpurnia comin from church that day what it was and she said ask you but i forgot to and now im askin you
32, his paper was now in his lap
20,again please he said
65,i told him in detail about our trip to church with calpurnia
148,atticus seemed to enjoy it but aunt alexandra who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing put down her embroidery and stared at us
62,you all were coming back from calpurnias church that sunday
29, jem said yessum she took us
24, i remembered something
74,yessum and she promised me i could come out to her house some afternoon
46,ill go next sunday if its all right can i
60,cal said shed come get me if you were off in the car
11, you may not
26, aunt alexandra said it
147,i wheeled around startled then turned back to atticus in time to catch his swift glance at her but it was too late
22,i said i didnt ask you
94, for a big man atticus could get up and down from a chair faster than anyone i ever knew
19,he was on his feet
33,apologize to your aunt he said
102,i didnt ask her i asked you   atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye
53,his voice was deadly first apologize to your aunt
29, im sorry aunty i muttered
17,now then he said
166,lets get this clear you do as calpurnia tells you you do as i tell you and as long as your aunts in this house you will do as she tells you
218, i understood pondered a while and concluded that the only way i could retire with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom where i stayed long enough to make them think i had to go
93,returning i lingered in the hall to hear a fierce discussion going on in the livingroom
168,through the door i could see jem on the sofa with a football magazine in front of his face his head turning as if its pages contained a live tennis match
56,youve got to do something about her aunty was saying
48,youve let things go on too long atticus too long
54, i dont see any harm in letting her go out there
53,cald look after her there as well as she does here
42, who was the her they were talking about
15,my heart sank me
147,i felt the starched walls of a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on me and for the second time in my life i thought of running away
11,immediately
104,atticus its all right to be softhearted youre an easy man but you have a daughter to think of
27,a daughter whos growing up
28, thats what i am thinking of
33, and dont try to get around it
73,youve got to face it sooner or later and it might as well be tonight
22,we dont need her now
98, atticus s voice was even alexandra calpurnias not leaving this house until she wants to
92,you may think otherwise but i couldnt have got along without her all these years
104,shes a faithful member of this family and youll simply have to accept things the way they are
94,besides sister i dont want you working your head off for us  youve no reason to do that
49,we still need cal as much as we ever did
109, but atticus besides i dont think the childrenve suffered one bit from her having brought them up
87,if anything shes been harder on them in some ways than a mother would have been
111,shes never let them get away with anything shes never indulged them the way most colored nurses do
134,she tried to bring them up according to her lights and cals lights are pretty good  and another thing the children love her
17, i breathed again
64,it wasnt me it was only calpurnia they were talking about
35,revived i entered the livingroom
97,atticus had retreated behind his newspaper and aunt alexandra was worrying her embroidery
50,punk punk punk her needle broke the taut circle
54,she stopped and pulled the cloth tighter punkpunkpunk
16,she was furious
40,jem got up and padded across the rug
27,he motioned me to follow
44,he led me to his room and closed the door
19,his face was grave
26,theyve been fussing scout
116, jem and i fussed a great deal these days but i had never heard of or seen anyone quarrel with atticus
30,it was not a comfortable sight
39,scout try not to antagonize aunty hear
92, atticuss remarks were still rankling which made me miss the request in jems question
22,my feathers rose again
32,you tryin to tell me what to do
68, naw its  hes got a lot on his mind now without us worrying him
67, atticus didnt appear to have anything especially on his mind
107,its this tom robinson case thats worryin him to death   i said atticus didnt worry about anything
90,besides the case never bothered us except about once a week and then it didnt last
87,thats because you cant hold something in your mind but a little while said jem
97,its different with grown folks we   his maddening superiority was unbearable these days
69,he didnt want to do anything but read and go off by himself
162,still everything he read he passed along to me but with this difference formerly because he thought id like it now for my edification and instruction
22,jee crawling hova jem
25,who do you think you are
77, now i mean it scout you antagonize aunty and ill  ill spank you
19, with that i was gone
34,you damn morphodite ill kill you
97, he was sitting on the bed and it was easy to grab his front hair and land one on his mouth
108,he slapped me and i tried another left but a punch in the stomach sent me sprawling on the floor
124,it nearly knocked the breath out of me but it didnt matter because i knew he was fighting he was fighting me back
20,we were still equals
36,aint so high and mighty now are you
30, i screamed sailing in again
150,he was still on the bed and i couldnt get a firm stance so i threw myself at him as hard as i could hitting pulling pinching gouging
49,what had begun as a fistfight became a brawl
52,we were still struggling when atticus separated us
17,thats all he said
30,both of you go to bed right now
14, i said at jem
41,he was being sent to bed at my bedtime
15,who started it
30, asked atticus in resignation
35,he was tryin to tell me what to do
33,i dont have to mind him now do i
14, atticus smiled
59,lets leave it at this you mind jem whenever he can make you
11,fair enough
108, aunt alexandra was present but silent and when she went down the hall with atticus we heard her say 
81,just one of the things ive been telling you about a phrase that united us again
84,ours were adjoining rooms as i shut the door between them jem said night scout
72, night i murmured picking my way across the room to turn on the light
82,as i passed the bed i stepped on something warm resilient and rather smooth
83,it was not quite like hard rubber and i had the sensation that it was alive
20,i also heard it move
64,i switched on the light and looked at the floor by the bed
39,whatever i had stepped on was gone
23,i tapped on jems door
12,what he said
21,how does a snake feel
15, sort of rough
34, i think theres one under my bed
19,can you come look
20, are you bein funny
20, jem opened the door
28,he was in his pajama bottoms
95,i noticed not without satisfaction that the mark of my knuckles was still on his mouth
128,when he saw i meant what i said he said if you think im gonna put my face down to a snake youve got another think comin
16,hold on a minute
51, he went to the kitchen and fetched the broom
38,you better get up on the bed he said
23,you reckon its really one
21,this was an occasion
179,our houses had no cellars they were built on stone blocks a few feet above the ground and the entry of reptiles was not unknown but was not commonplace
246,miss rachel haverfords excuse for a glass of neat whiskey every morning was that she never got over the fright of finding a rattler coiled in her bedroom closet on her washing when she went to hang up her negligee
43,jem made a tentative swipe under the bed
55,i looked over the foot to see if a snake would come out
24,jem made a deeper swipe
15,do snakes grunt
26, it aint a snake jem said
12,its somebody
56, suddenly a filthy brown package shot from under the bed
74,jem raised the broom and missed dills head by an inch when it appeared
12,god almighty
24, jems voice was reverent
34,we watched dill emerge by degrees
16,he was a tight fit
110,he stood up and eased his shoulders turned his feet in their ankle sockets rubbed the back of his neck
35,his circulation restored he said hey
27, jem petitioned god again
17,i was speechless
27,im bout to perish said dill
20,got anything to eat
33, in a dream i went to the kitchen
90,i brought him back some milk and half a pan of corn bread left over from supper
69,dill devoured it chewing with his front teeth as was his custom
25,i finally found my voice
18,howd you get here
22, by an involved route
454,refreshed by food dill recited this narrative having been bound in chains and left to die in the basement there were basements in meridian by his new father who disliked him and secretly kept alive on raw field peas by a passing farmer who heard his cries for help the good man poked a bushel pod by pod through the ventilator dill worked himself free by pulling the chains from the wall
171,still in wrist manacles he wandered two miles out of meridian where he discovered a small animal show and was immediately engaged to wash the camel
178,he traveled with the show all over mississippi until his infallible sense of direction told him he was in abbott county alabama just across the river from maycomb
31,he walked the rest of the way
18,howd you get here
133,he had taken thirteen dollars from his mothers purse caught the nine oclock from meridian and got off at maycomb junction
233,he had walked ten or eleven of the fourteen miles to maycomb off the highway in the scrub bushes lest the authorities be seeking him and had ridden the remainder of the way clinging to the backboard of a cotton wagon
164,he had been under the bed for two hours he thought he had heard us in the diningroom and the clink of forks on plates nearly drove him crazy
251,he thought jem and i would never go to bed he had considered emerging and helping me beat jem as jem had grown far taller but he knew mr finch would break it up soon so he thought it best to stay where he was
45,he was worn out dirty beyond belief and home
38,they must not know youre here said jem
108,wed know if they were lookin for you think theyre still searchin all the picture shows in meridian
12, dill grinned
61,you oughta let your mother know where you are said jem
37,you oughta let her know youre here
59, dills eyes flickered at jem and jem looked at the floor
62,then he rose and broke the remaining code of our childhood
50,he went out of the room and down the hall
65,atticus his voice was distant can you come here a minute sir
56, beneath its sweatstreaked dirt dills face went white
11,i felt sick
25,atticus was in the doorway
100,he came to the middle of the room and stood with his hands in his pockets looking down at dill
41,i finally found my voice its okay dill
49,when he wants you to know somethin he tells you
18, dill looked at me
29,i mean its all right i said
71,you know he wouldnt bother you you know you aint scared of atticus
13, im not scared
15, dill muttered
20,just hungry ill bet
50, atticuss voice had its usual pleasant dryness
65,scout we can do better than a pan of cold corn bread cant we
75,you fill this fellow up and when i get back well see what we can see
68, mr finch dont tell aunt rachel dont make me go back please sir
21,ill run off again  
22, whoa son said atticus
66,nobodys about to make you go anywhere but to bed pretty soon
141,im just going over to tell miss rachel youre here and ask her if you could spend the night with us  youd like that wouldnt you
117,and for goodness sake put some of the county back where it belongs the soil erosions bad enough as it is
46, dill stared at my fathers retreating figure
29,hes tryin to be funny i said
22,he means take a bath
45,see there i told you he wouldnt bother you
79, jem was standing in a corner of the room looking like the traitor he was
33,dill i had to tell him he said
72,you cant run three hundred miles off without your mother knowin
28, we left him without a word
25,dill ate and ate and ate
33,he hadnt eaten since last night
429,he used all his money for a ticket boarded the train as he had done many times coolly chatted with the conductor to whom dill was a familiar sight but he had not the nerve to invoke the rule on small children traveling a distance alone if youve lost your money the conductor will lend you enough for dinner and your father will pay him back at the end of the line
168,dill made his way through the leftovers and was reaching for a can of pork and beans in the pantry when miss rachels dooo jesus went off in the hall
25,he shivered like a rabbit
275,he bore with fortitude her wait till i get you home your folks are out of their minds worryin was quite calm during thats all the harris in you coming out smiled at her reckon you can stay one night and returned the hug at long last bestowed upon him
52,atticus pushed up his glasses and rubbed his face
78,your fathers tired said aunt alexandra her first words in hours it seemed
67,she had been there but i suppose struck dumb most of the time
28,you children get to bed now
64, we left them in the diningroom atticus still mopping his face
56,from rape to riot to runaways we heard him chuckle
47,i wonder what the next two hours will bring
99, since things appeared to have worked out pretty well dill and i decided to be civil to jem
72,besides dill had to sleep with him so we might as well speak to him
98,i put on my pajamas read for a while and found myself suddenly unable to keep my eyes open
126,dill and jem were quiet when i turned off my reading lamp there was no strip of light under the door to jems room
120,i must have slept a long time for when i was punched awake the room was dim with the light of the setting moon
14,move over scout
36, he thought he had to i mumbled
22,dont stay mad with him
26, dill got in bed beside me
14,i aint he said
33,i just wanted to sleep with you
17,are you waked up
35, by this time i was but lazily so
14,whyd you do it
24,i said whyd you run off
37,was he really hateful like you said
65, naw didnt you all build that boat like you wrote you were gonna
22, he just said we would
12,we never did
47, i raised up on my elbow facing dills outline
24,its no reason to run off
84,they dont get around to doin what they say theyre gonna do half the time
52, that wasnt it he  they just wasnt interested in me
64, this was the weirdest reason for flight i had ever heard
111, well they stayed gone all the time and when they were home even theyd get off in a room by themselves
22, whatd they do in there
67, nothin just sittin and readin  but they didnt want me with em
48, i pushed the pillow to the headboard and sat up
19,you know something
60,i was fixin to run off tonight because there they all were
98,you dont want em around you all the time dill   dill breathed his patient breath a halfsigh
212,  good night atticuss gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the legislature and i dont know what  you dont want em around all the time dill you couldnt do anything if they were
12, thats not it
214, as dill explained i found myself wondering what life would be if jem were different even from what he was now what i would do if atticus did not feel the necessity of my presence help and advice
46,why he couldnt get along a day without me
54,even calpurnia couldnt get along unless i was there
14,they needed me
74,dill you aint telling me right  your folks couldnt do without you
32,they must be just mean to you
205,tell you what to do about that   dills voice went on steadily in the darkness the thing is what im tryin to say is  they do get on a lot better without me i cant help them any
12,they aint mean
68,they buy me everything i want but its now  youvegotitgoplaywithit
30,youve got a roomful of things
27,igotyouthatbooksogoreadit
32, dill tried to deepen his voice
14,youre not a boy
112,boys get out and play baseball with other boys they dont hang around the house worryin their folks
51, dills voice was his own again oh they aint mean
129,they kiss you and hug you good night and good mornin and goodbye and tell you they love you  scout lets get us a baby
165, there was a man dill had heard of who had a boat that he rowed across to a foggy island where all these babies were you could order one  thats a lie
42,aunty said god drops em down the chimney
38,at least thats what i think she said
52, for once auntys diction had not been too clear
16,well that aint so
33,you get babies from each other
106,but theres this man too  he has all these babies just waitin to wake up he breathes life into em
21, dill was off again
48,beautiful things floated around in his dreamy head
88,he could read two books to my one but he preferred the magic of his own inventions
208,he could add and subtract faster than lightning but he preferred his own twilight world a world where babies slept waiting to be gathered like morning lilies
185,he was slowly talking himself to sleep and taking me with him but in the quietness of his foggy island there rose the faded image of a gray house with sad brown doors
45, why do you reckon boo radleys never run off
53, dill sighed a long sigh and turned away from me
46,maybe he doesnt have anywhere to run off to
201, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  after many telephone calls much pleading on behalf of the defendant and a long forgiving letter from his mother it was decided that dill could stay
33,we had a week of peace together
29,after that little it seemed
25,a nightmare was upon us
34,it began one evening after supper
131,dill was over aunt alexandra was in her chair in the corner atticus was in his jem and i were on the floor reading
358,it had been a placid week i had minded aunty jem had outgrown the treehouse but helped dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make boo radley come out at no cost to ourselves place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to the front yard and hed follow it like an ant
86,there was a knock on the front door jem answered it and said it was mr heck tate
39,well ask him to come in said atticus
13,i already did
65,theres some men outside in the yard they want you to come out
102, in maycomb grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons death and politics
24,i wondered who had died
78,jem and i went to the front door but atticus called go back in the house
82, jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen
23,aunt alexandra protested
54,just for a second aunty lets see who it is he said
31,dill and i took another window
43,a crowd of men was standing around atticus
40,they all seemed to be talking at once
139,movin him to the county jail tomorrow mr tate was saying i dont look for any trouble but i cant guarantee there wont be any
37, dont be foolish heck atticus said
17,this is maycomb
22,said i was just uneasy
113, heck weve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure theres nothing to be uneasy about
31,this is saturday atticus said
28,trialll probably be monday
37,you can keep him one night cant you
80,i dont think anybody in maycomb tl begrudge me a client with times this hard
167, there was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when mr link deas said nobody around heres up to anything its that old sarum bunch im worried about
32,cant you get a  what is it heck
29, change of venue said mr tate
34,not much point in that now is it
38, atticus said something inaudible
42,i turned to jem who waved me to silence
80,  besides atticus was saying youre not scared of that crowd are you
42,know how they do when they get shinnied up
73, they dont usually drink on sunday they go to church most of the day
11,atticus said
51,this is a special occasion though someone said
124,they murmured and buzzed until aunty said if jem didnt turn on the livingroom lights he would disgrace the family
19,jem didnt hear her
78,  dont see why you touched it in the first place mr link deas was saying
48,youve got everything to lose from this atticus
17,i mean everything
23, do you really think so
37, this was atticus s dangerous question
49,do you really think you want to move there scout
62, bam bam bam and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men
30,do you really think that son
13,then read this
85, jem would struggle the rest of an evening through the speeches of henry w grady
80,link that boy might go to the chair but hes not going till the truths told
25, atticuss voice was even
31,and you know what the truth is
157, there was a murmur among the group of men made more ominous when atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to him
56,suddenly jem screamed atticus the telephones ringing
153, the men jumped a little and scattered they were people we saw every day merchants intown farmers dr reynolds was there so was mr avery
35,well answer it son called atticus
21,laughter broke them up
162,when atticus switched on the overhead light in the livingroom he found jem at the window pale except for the vivid mark of the screen on his nose
47,why on earth are you all sitting in the dark
63,jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper
168,i sometimes think atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil evaluation behind the mobile register the birmingham news and the montgomery advertiser
32,they were after you werent they
16, jem went to him
36,they wanted to get you didnt they
44, atticus lowered the paper and gazed at jem
27,what have you been reading
54,then he said gently no son those were our friends
20, it wasnt a  a gang
47, jem was looking from the corners of his eyes
53,atticus tried to stifle a smile but didnt make it
53,no we dont have mobs and that nonsense in maycomb
37,ive never heard of a gang in maycomb
46, ku klux got after some catholics one time
115, never heard of any catholics in maycomb either said atticus youre confusing that with something else
114,way back about nineteen twenty there was a klan but it was a political organization more than anything
46,besides they couldnt find anybody to scare
199,they paraded by mr sam levys house one night but sam just stood on his porch and told em things had come to a pretty pass hed sold em the very sheets on their backs
50,sam made em so ashamed of themselves they went away
218, the levy family met all criteria for being fine folks they did the best they could with the sense they had and they had been living on the same plot of ground in maycomb for five generations
29,the ku kluxs gone said atticus
21,itll never come back
87, i walked home with dill and returned in time to overhear atticus saying to aunty 
212,in favor of southern womanhood as much as anybody but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again
71,i sought jem and found him in his room on the bed deep in thought
22,have they been at it
43,she wont let him alone about tom robinson
52,she almost said atticus was disgracin the family
10, scareda what
20, scared about atticus
23,somebody might hurt him
107, jem preferred to remain mysterious all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone
20,next day was sunday
172,in the interval between sunday school and church when the congregation stretched its legs i saw atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men
71,mr heck tate was present and i wondered if he had seen the light
23,he never went to church
28,even mr underwood was there
127,mr underwood had no use for any organization but the maycomb tribune of which he was the sole owner editor and printer
134,his days were spent at his linotype where he refreshed himself occasionally from an everpresent gallon jug of cherry wine
50,he rarely gathered news people brought it to him
133,it was said that he made up every edition of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype
20,this was believable
58,something must have been up to haul mr underwood out
110,i caught atticus coming in the door and he said that theyd moved tom robinson to the maycomb jail
158,he also said more to himself than to me that if theyd kept him there in the first place there wouldnt have been any fuss
151,i watched him take his seat on the third row from the front and i heard him rumble nearer my god to thee some notes behind the rest of us
33,he never sat with aunty jem and me
37,he liked to be by himself in church
103,the fake peace that prevailed on sundays was made more irritating by aunt alexandras presence
167,atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner where if we sometimes looked in on him we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading
133,aunt alexandra composed herself for a twohour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard the neighborhood was resting
84,jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines
79,so dill and i spent our sundays creeping around in deers pasture
131,shooting on sundays was prohibited so dill and i kicked jems football around the pasture for a while which was no fun
50,dill asked if id like to have a poke at boo radley
128,i said i didnt think itd be nice to bother him and spent the rest of the afternoon filling dill in on last winters events
30,he was considerably impressed
263,we parted at suppertime and after our meal jem and i were settling down to a routine evening when atticus did something that interested us he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension cord
31,there was a light bulb on the end
33,im going out for a while he said
70,you folks  be in bed when i come back so ill say good night now
61, with that he put his hat on and went out the back door
27,hes takin the car said jem
106,our father had a few peculiarities one was he never ate desserts another was that he liked to walk
266,as far back as i could remember there was always a chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse and atticus put many miles on it in business trips but in maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day covering about two miles
37,he said his only exercise was walking
147,in maycomb if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind it was correct to believe ones mind incapable of definite purpose
136,later on i bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a book when i heard jem rattling around in his room
108,his gotobed noises were so familiar to me that i knocked on his door why aint you going to bed
29, im goin downtown for a while
29, he was changing his pants
27,its almost ten oclock jem
37, he knew it but he was going anyway
22,then im goin with you
44,if you say no youre not im goin anyway hear
164, jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home and i suppose he thought a fight would antagonize aunty so he gave in with little grace
18,i dressed quickly
84,we waited until auntys light went out and we walked quietly down the back steps
25,there was no moon tonight
28,dill  wanta come i whispered
27,so he will said jem gloomily
97,we leaped over the driveway wall cut through miss rachels side yard and went to dills window
22,jem whistled bobwhite
123,dills face appeared at the screen disappeared and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out
70,an old campaigner he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk
89, jems got the lookarounds an affliction calpurnia said all boys caught at his age
53,ive just got this feeling jem said just this feeling
119, we went by mrs duboses house standing empty and shuttered her camellias grown up in weeds and johnson grass
57,there were eight more houses to the post office corner
42,the south side of the square was deserted
136,giant monkeypuzzle bushes bristled on each corner and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street lights
88,a light shone in the county toilet otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark
108,a larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square dim lights burned from deep within them
178,atticuss office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice but after several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the maycomb bank building
88,when we rounded the corner of the square we saw the car parked in front of the bank
23,hes in there said jem
11,but he wasnt
45,his office was reached by a long hallway
155,looking down the hall we should have seen atticus finch attorneyatlaw in small sober letters against the light from behind his door
10,it was dark
44,jem peered in the bank door to make sure
17,he turned the knob
20,the door was locked
20,lets go up the street
21,maybe hes visitin mr
75, mr underwood not only ran the maycomb tribune office he lived in it
17,that is above it
100,he covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his upstairs window
124,the office building was on the northwest corner of the square and to reach it we had to pass the jail
82,the maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the countys buildings
91,atticus said it was like something cousin joshua st clair might have designed
30,it was certainly someones dream
225,starkly out of place in a town of squarefaced stores and steeproofed houses the maycomb jail was a miniature gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses
111,its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows
112,it stood on no lonely hill but was wedged between tyndals hardware store and the maycomb tribune office
273,the jail was maycomb s only conversation piece its detractors said it looked like a victorian privy its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers
87,as we walked up the sidewalk we saw a solitary light burning in the distance
58,thats funny said jem jail doesnt have an outside light
40, looks like its over the door said dill
118,a long extension cord ran between the bars of a second floor window and down the side of the building
94,in the light from its bare bulb atticus was sitting propped against the front door
123,he was sitting in one of his office chairs and he was reading oblivious of the nightbugs dancing over his head
35,i made to run but jem caught me
45,dont go to him he said he might not like it
25,hes all right lets go home
37,i just wanted to see where he was
140, we were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars came in from the meridian highway moving slowly in a line
93,they went around the square passed the bank building and stopped in front of the jail
13,nobody got out
41,we saw atticus look up from his newspaper
108,he closed it folded it deliberately dropped it in his lap and pushed his hat to the back of his head
33,he seemed to be expecting them
21,come on whispered jem
105,we streaked across the square across the street until we were in the shelter of the jitney jungle door
28,jem peeked up the sidewalk
27,we can get closer he said
70,we ran to tyndals hardware door  near enough at the same time discreet
42,in ones and twos men got out of the cars
92,shadows became substance as lights revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door
29,atticus remained where he was
26,the men hid him from view
15,he in there mr
10, a man said
50,he is we heard atticus answer and hes asleep
17,dont wake him up
170, in obedience to my father there followed what i later realized was a sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation the men talked in near whispers
41,you know what we want another man said
27,get aside from the door mr
77, you can turn around and go home again walter atticus said pleasantly
28,heck tates around somewhere
34, the hell he is said another man
69,hecks bunchs so deep in the woods they wont get out till mornin
55, called em off on a snipe hunt was the succinct answer
27,didnt you think athat mr
39, thought about it but didnt believe it
83,well then my fathers voice was still the same that changes things doesnt it
29, it do another deep voice said
24,its owner was a shadow
21,do you really think so
124, this was the second time i heard atticus ask that question in two days and it meant somebodys man would get jumped
26,this was too good to miss
69,i broke away from jem and ran as fast as i could to atticus
79,jem shrieked and tried to catch me but i had a lead on him and dill
89,i pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of light
11,hey atticus
73, i thought he would have a fine surprise but his face killed my joy
105,a flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes but returned when dill and jem wriggled into the light
146,there was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about and when i glanced around i discovered that these men were strangers
43,they were not the people i saw last night
120,hot embarrassment shot through me i had leaped triumphantly into a ring of people i had never seen before
78,atticus got up from his chair but he was moving slowly like an old man
93,he put the newspaper down very carefully adjusting its creases with lingering fingers
29,they were trembling a little
19,go home jem he said
25,take scout and dill home
174, we were accustomed to prompt if not always cheerful acquiescence to atticuss instructions but from the way he stood jem was not thinking of budging
14,go home i said
19, jem shook his head
337,as atticuss fists went to his hips so did jems and as they faced each other i could see little resemblance between them jems soft brown hair and eyes his oval face and snugfitting ears were our mothers contrasting oddly with atticuss graying black hair and squarecut features but they were somehow alike
32,mutual defiance made them alike
16,son i said go home
19, jem shook his head
79,ill send him home a burly man said and grabbed jem roughly by the collar
35,he yanked jem nearly off his feet
19,dont you touch him
25, i kicked the man swiftly
61,barefooted i was surprised to see him fall back in real pain
49,i intended to kick his shin but aimed too high
14,thatll do scout
38, atticus put his hand on my shoulder
16,dont kick folks
45,no   he said as i was pleading justification
43,aint nobody gonna do jem that way i said
53,all right mr finch get em outa here someone growled
51,you got fifteen seconds to get em outa here
87, in the midst of this strange assembly atticus stood trying to make jem mind him
111,i aint going was his steady answer to atticuss threats requests and finally please jem take them home
164, i was getting a bit tired of that but felt jem had his own reasons for doing as he did in view of his prospects once atticus did get him home
25,i looked around the crowd
126,it was a summers night but the men were dressed most of them in overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars
97,i thought they must be cold natured as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs
54,some wore hats pulled firmly down over their ears
78,they were sullenlooking sleepyeyed men who seemed unused to late hours
94,i sought once more for a familiar face and at the center of the semicircle i found one
37, the man did not hear me it seemed
17,hey mr cunningham
36,hows your entailment gettin along
111, mr walter cunninghams legal affairs were well known to me atticus had once described them at length
75,the big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his overall straps
64,he seemed uncomfortable he cleared his throat and looked away
36,my friendly overture had fallen flat
172,mr cunningham wore no hat and the top half of his forehead was white in contrast to his sunscorched face which led me to believe that he wore one most days
47,he shifted his feet clad in heavy work shoes
34,dont you remember me mr cunningham
20,im jean louise finch
52,you brought us some hickory nuts one time remember
94, i began to sense the futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance
44,i go to school with walter i began again
21,hes your boy aint he
11,aint he sir
42, mr cunningham was moved to a faint nod
25,he did know me after all
44,hes in my grade i said and he does right well
41,hes a good boy i added a real nice boy
43,we brought him home for dinner one time
91,maybe he told you about me i beat him up one time but he was real nice about it
30,tell him hey for me wont you
155, atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what they were interested in not about what you were interested in
152,mr cunningham displayed no interest in his son so i tackled his entailment once more in a lastditch effort to make him feel at home
126,entailments are bad i was advising him when i slowly awoke to the fact that i was addressing the entire aggregation
70,the men were all looking at me some had their mouths halfopen
82,atticus had stopped poking at jem they were standing together beside dill
38,their attention amounted to fascination
84,atticus s mouth even was halfopen an attitude he had once described as uncouth
27,our eyes met and he shut it
155,well atticus i was just sayin to mr cunningham that entailments are bad an all that but you said not to worry it takes a long time sometimes
35,that you alld ride it out together
72, i was slowly drying up wondering what idiocy i had committed
57,entailments seemed all right enough for livingroom talk
133,i began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair i could stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me
21,they were quite still
17,whats the matter
19,atticus said nothing
74,i looked around and up at mr cunningham whose face was equally impassive
27,then he did a peculiar thing
53,he squatted down and took me by both shoulders
45,ill tell him you said hey little lady he said
47,then he straightened up and waved a big paw
26,lets clear out he called
20,lets get going boys
96, as they had come in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their ramshackle cars
49,doors slammed engines coughed and they were gone
117,i turned to atticus but atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning against it with his face to the wall
40,i went to him and pulled his sleeve
19,can we go home now
100, he nodded produced his handkerchief gave his face a goingover and blew his nose violently
64, a soft husky voice came from the darkness above they gone
37, atticus stepped back and looked up
18,theyve gone he said
16,get some sleep tom
29,they wont bother you any more
110, from a different direction another voice cut crisply through the night youre damn tootin they wont
37,had you covered all the time atticus
112, mr underwood and a doublebarreled shotgun were leaning out his window above the maycomb tribune office
202,it was long past my bedtime and i was growing quite tired it seemed that atticus and mr underwood would talk for the rest of the night mr underwood out the window and atticus up at him
103,finally atticus returned switched off the light above the jail door and picked up his chair
26,can i carry it for you mr
12, asked dill
40,he had not said a word the whole time
17,why thank you son
82, walking toward the office dill and i fell into step behind atticus and jem
61,dill was encumbered by the chair and his pace was slower
136,atticus and jem were well ahead of us and i assumed that atticus was giving him hell for not going home but i was wrong
117,as they passed under a streetlight atticus reached out and massaged jems hair his one gesture of affection
45,contents  p rev  next chapter  jem heard me
47,he thrust his head around the connecting door
49,as he came to my bed atticus s light flashed on
112,we stayed where we were until it went off we heard him turn over and we waited until he was still again
55,jem took me to his room and put me in bed beside him
71,try to go to sleep he said itll be all over after tomorrow maybe
51, we had come in quietly so as not to wake aunty
142,atticus killed the engine in the driveway and coasted to the carhouse we went in the back door and to our rooms without a word
251,i was very tired and was drifting into sleep when the memory of atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became atticus standing in the middle of an empty waiting street pushing up his glasses
74,the full meaning of the nights events hit me and i began crying
133,jem was awfully nice about it for once he didnt remind me that people nearly nine years old didnt do things like that
98,everybodys appetite was delicate this morning except jems he ate his way through three eggs
109,atticus watched in frank admiration aunt alexandra sipped coffee and radiated waves of disapproval
65,children who slipped out at night were a disgrace to the family
130,atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come along but aunty said nonsense mr underwood was there all the time
58, you know its a funny thing about braxton said atticus
45,he despises negroes wont have one near him
192, local opinion held mr underwood to be an intense profane little man whose father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg a name mr underwood had done his best to live down
85,atticus said naming people after confederate generals made slow steady drinkers
128,calpurnia was serving aunt alexandra more coffee and she shook her head at what i thought was a pleading winning look
30,youre still too little she said
28,ill tell you when you aint
36, i said it might help my stomach
56,all right she said and got a cup from the sideboard
103,she poured one tablespoonful of coffee into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk
99,i thanked her by sticking out my tongue at it and looked up to catch auntys warning frown
31,but she was frowning at atticus
101,she waited until calpurnia was in the kitchen then she said dont talk like that in front of them
35, talk like what in front of whom
29,like that in front of calpurnia
72,you said braxton underwood despises negroes right in front of her
29, well im sure cal knows it
33,everybody in maycomb knows it
134, i was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days that came out when he talked with aunt alexandra
56,it was a quiet digging in never outright irritation
135,there was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said anything fit to say at the tables fit to say in front of calpurnia
45,she knows what she means to this family
41, i dont think its a good habit atticus
16,it encourages them
42,you know how they talk among themselves
78,every thing that happens in this towns out to the quarters before sundown
32, my father put down his knife
50,i dont know of any law that says they cant talk
72,maybe if we didnt give them so much to talk about theyd be quiet
38,why dont you drink your coffee scout
35, i was playing in it with the spoon
46,i thought mr cunningham was a friend of ours
37,you told me a long time ago he was
12, he still is
37, but last night he wanted to hurt you
74, atticus placed his fork beside his knife and pushed his plate aside
105,mr cunninghams basically a good man he said he just has his blind spots along with the rest of us
30,dont call that a blind spot
58,heda killed you last night when he first went there
120,he might have hurt me a little atticus conceded but son youll understand folks a little better when youre older
51,a mobs always made up of people no matter what
69,mr cunningham was part of a mob last night but he was still a man
125,every mob in every little southern town is always made up of people you know  doesnt say much for them does it
21, ill say not said jem
73,so it took an eightyearold child to bring em to their senses didnt it
13, said atticus
102,that proves something  that a gang of wild animals can be stopped simply because theyre still human
50,hmp maybe we need a police force of children
86,you children last night made walter cunningham stand in my shoes for a minute
17,that was enough
90, well i hoped jem would understand folks a little better when he was older i wouldnt
68,first day walter comes back to schoolll be his last i affirmed
43,you will not touch him atticus said flatly
91,i dont want either of you bearing a grudge about this thing no matter what happens
74, you see dont you said aunt alexandra what comes of things like this
27,dont say i havent told you
67, atticus said hed never say that pushed out his chair and got up
32,theres a day ahead so excuse me
54,jem i dont want you and scout downtown today please
76, as atticus departed dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom
120,its all over town this morning he announced all about how we held off a hundred folks with our bare hands
38, aunt alexandra stared him to silence
70,it was not a hundred folks she said and nobody held anybody off
62,it was just a nest of those cunninghams drunk and disorderly
43, aw aunty thats just dills way said jem
26,he signaled us to follow him
83,you all stay in the yard today she said as we made our way to the front porch
20,it was like saturday
96,people from the south end of the county passed our house in a leisurely but steady stream
52,mr dolphus raymond lurched by on his thoroughbred
52,dont see how he stays in the saddle murmured jem
55,how cn you stand to get drunk fore eight in the morning
37, a wagonload of ladies rattled past us
63,they wore cotton sunbonnets and dresses with long sleeves
41,a bearded man in a wool hat drove them
42,yonder s some mennonites jem said to dill
24,they dont have buttons
106, they lived deep in the woods did most of their trading across the river and rarely came to maycomb
20,dill was interested
85,theyve all got blue eyes jem explained and the men cant shave after they marry
58,their wives like for em to tickle em with their beards
47, mr x billups rode by on a mule and waved to us
25,hes a funny man said jem
30,xs his name not his initial
59,he was in court one time and they asked him his name
17,he said x billups
45,clerk asked him to spell it and he said x
28,asked him again and he said x
94,they kept at it till he wrote x on a sheet of paper and held it up for everybody to see
117,they asked him where he got his name and he said thats the way his folks signed him up when he was born
340, as the county went by us jem gave dill the histories and general attitudes of the more prominent figures mr tensaw jones voted the straight prohibition ticket miss emily davis dipped snuff in private mr byron waller could play the violin mr jake slade was cutting his third set of teeth
60,a wagonload of unusually stern faced citizens appeared
127,when they pointed to miss maudie atkinsons yard ablaze with summer flowers miss maudie herself came out on the porch
188,there was an odd thing about miss maudie  on her porch she was too far away for us to see her features clearly but we could always catch her mood by the way she stood
145,she was now standing arms akimbo her shoulders drooping a little her head cocked to one side her glasses winking in the sunlight
55,we knew she wore a grin of the uttermost wickedness
135,the driver of the wagon slowed down his mules and a shrillvoiced woman called out he that cometh in vanity departeth in darkness
69, miss maudie answered a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance
142, i guess that the footwashers thought that the devil was quoting scripture for his own purposes as the driver speeded his mules
205,why they objected to miss maudies yard was a mystery heightened in my mind because for someone who spent all the daylight hours outdoors miss maudies command of scripture was formidable
31,you goin to court this morning
21,we had strolled over
17,i am not she said
50,i have no business with the court this morning
29, arent you goin down to watch
10, asked dill
56,ts morbid watching a poor devil on trial for his life
54,look at all those folks its like a roman carnival
50, they hafta try him in public miss maudie i said
33,wouldnt be right if they didnt
32, im quite aware of that she said
50,just because its public i dont have to go do i
33, miss stephanie crawford came by
26,she wore a hat and gloves
19,um um urn she said
73,look at all those folks  youd think william jennings bryan was speakin
36, and where are you going stephanie
20, inquired miss maudie
20,to the jitney jungle
103, miss maudie said shed never seen miss stephanie go to the jitney jungle in a hat in her life
118,well said miss stephanie i thought i might just look in at the courthouse to see what atticuss up to
51, better be careful he doesnt hand you a subpoena
156, we asked miss maudie to elucidate she said miss stephanie seemed to know so much about the case she might as well be called on to testify
125,we held off until noon when atticus came home to dinner and said theyd spent the morning picking the jury
58,after dinner we stopped by for dill and went to town
23,it was a gala occasion
138,there was no room at the public hitching rail for another animal mules and wagons were parked under every available tree
147,the courthouse square was covered with picnic parties sitting on newspapers washing down biscuit and syrup with warm milk from fruit jars
72,some people were gnawing on cold chicken and cold fried pork chops
97,the more affluent chased their food with drugstore cocacola in bulbshaped soda glasses
101,greasyfaced children popped thewhip through the crowd and babies lunched at their mothers breasts
150,in a far corner of the square the negroes sat quietly in the sun dining on sardines crackers and the more vivid flavors of nehi cola
35,mr dolphus raymond sat with them
43,jem said dill hes drinkin out of a sack
133, mr dolphus raymond seemed to be so doing two yellow drugstore straws ran from his mouth to the depths of a brown paper bag
46,aint ever seen anybody do that murmured dill
37,how does he keep whats in it in it
12, jem giggled
48,hes got a cocola bottle full of whiskey in there
35,thats sos not to upset the ladies
90,youll see him sip it all afternoon hell step out for a while and fill it back up
40, whys he sittin with the colored folks
13, always does
42,he likes em bettern he likes us i reckon
49,lives by himself way down near the county line
57,hes got a colored woman and all sorts of mixed chillun
36,show you some of em if we see em
39, he doesnt look like trash said dill
110,hes not he owns all one side of the riverbank down there and hes from a real old family to boot
31, then why does he do like that
29, thats just his way said jem
38,they say he never got over his weddin
67,he was supposed to marry one of the  the spencer ladies i think
123,they were gonna have a huge weddin but they didnt  after the rehearsal the bride went upstairs and blew her head off
37,she pulled the trigger with her toes
24, did they ever know why
60, no said jem nobody ever knew quite why but mr dolphus
128,they said it was because she found out about his colored woman he reckoned he could keep her and get married too
34,hes been sorta drunk ever since
86,you know though hes real good to those chillun   jem i asked whats a mixed child
25, half white half colored
20,youve seen em scout
68,you know that redkinky headed one that delivers for the drugstore
15,hes half white
16,theyre real sad
13, sad how come
28, they dont belong anywhere
170,colored folks wont have em because theyre half white white folks wont have em cause theyre colored so theyre just in betweens dont belong anywhere
61,but mr dolphus now they say hes shipped two of his up north
29,they dont mind em up north
18,yonders one of em
61, a small boy clutching a negro womans hand walked toward us
99,he looked all negro to me he was rich chocolate with flaring nostrils and beautiful teeth
92,sometimes he would skip happily and the negro woman tugged his hand to make him stop
30,jem waited until they passed us
40,thats one of the little ones he said
16,how can you tell
11, asked dill
22,he looked black to me
57, you cant sometimes not unless you know who they are
34,but hes half raymond all right
21, but how can you tell
47,i told you scout you just hafta know who they are
41, well how do you know we aint negroes
44, uncle jack finch says we really dont know
151,he says as far as he can trace back the finches we aint but for all he knows we mighta come straight out of ethiopia durin the old testament
76, well if we came out durin the old testament its too long ago to matter
124, thats what i thought said jem but around here once you have a drop of negro blood that makes you all black
146,hey look   some invisible signal had made the lunchers on the square rise and scatter bits of newspaper cellophane and wrapping paper
164,children came to mothers babies were cradled on hips as men in sweatstained hats collected their families and herded them through the courthouse doors
108,in the far corner of the square the negroes and mr dolphus raymond stood up and dusted their breeches
96,there were few women and children among them which seemed to dispel the holiday mood
67,they waited patiently at the doors behind the white families
21,lets go in said dill
93,naw we better wait till they get in atticus might not like it if he sees us said jem
200,the maycomb county courthouse was faintly reminiscent of arlington in one respect the concrete pillars supporting its south roof were too heavy for their light burden
91,the pillars were all that remained standing when the original courthouse burned in 
41,another courthouse was built around them
45,it is better to say built in spite of them
146,but for the south porch the maycomb county courthouse was early victorian presenting an unoffensive vista when seen from the north
245,from the other side however greek revival columns clashed with a big nineteenthcentury clock tower housing a rusty unreliable instrument a view indicating a people determined to preserve every physical scrap of the past
344,to reach the courtroom on the second floor one passed sundry sunless county cubbyholes the tax assessor the tax collector the county clerk the county solicitor the circuit clerk the judge of probate lived in cool dim hutches that smelled of decaying record books mingled with old damp cement and stale urine
120,it was necessary to turn on the lights in the daytime there was always a film of dust on the rough floorboards
140,the inhabitants of these offices were creatures of their environment little grayfaced men they seemed untouched by wind or sun
112,we knew there was a crowd but we had not bargained for the multitudes in the firstfloor hallway
138,i got separated from jem and dill but made my way toward the wall by the stairwell knowing jem would come for me eventually
101,i found myself in the middle of the idlers club and made myself as unobtrusive as possible
236,this was a group of whiteshirted khakitrousered suspendered old men who had spent their lives doing nothing and passed their twilight days doing same on pine benches under the live oaks on the square
142,attentive critics of courthouse business atticus said they knew as much law as the chief justice from long years of observation
138,normally they were the courts only spectators and today they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine
63,when they spoke their voices sounded casually important
37,the conversation was about my father
40,thinks he knows what hes doing one said
42,ohh now i wouldnt say that said another
54,atticus finchs a deep reader a mighty deep reader
41, he reads all right thats all he does
18, the club snickered
108,lemme tell you somethin now billy a third said you know the court appointed him to defend this nigger
38, yeah but atticus aims to defend him
36,thats what i dont like about it
116, this was news news that put a different light on things atticus had to whether he wanted to or not
135,i thought it odd that he hadnt said anything to us about it  we could have used it many times in defending him and ourselves
77,he had to thats why he was doing it equaled fewer fights and less fussing
44,but did that explain the towns attitude
44,the court appointed atticus to defend him
26,atticus aimed to defend him
36,thats what they didnt like about it
16,it was confusing
83,the negroes having waited for the white people to go upstairs began to come in
75,whoa now just a minute said a club member holding up his walking stick
51,just dont start up them there stairs yet awhile
108, the club began its stiffjointed climb and ran into dill and jem on their way down looking for me
74,they squeezed past and jem called scout come on there aint a seat left
19,well hafta stand up
16, looka there now
58, he said irritably as the black people surged upstairs
68,the old men ahead of them would take most of the standing room
60,we were out of luck and it was my fault jem informed me
30,we stood miserably by the wall
20,cant you all get in
61, reverend sykes was looking down at us black hat in hand
22,hey reverend said jem
27,naw scout here messed us up
30, well lets see what we can do
41, reverend sykes edged his way upstairs
30,in a few moments he was back
31,theres not a seat downstairs
85,do you all reckon itll be all right if you all came to the balcony with me
18, gosh yes said jem
71,happily we sped ahead of reverend sykes to the courtroom floor
63,there we went up a covered staircase and waited at the door
110,reverend sykes came puffing behind us and steered us gently through the black people in the balcony
49,four negroes rose and gave us their frontrow seats
132,the colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a secondstory veranda and from it we could see everything
45,the jury sat to the left under long windows
160,sunburned lanky they seemed to be all farmers but this was natural townfolk rarely sat on juries they were either struck or excused
68,one or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressedup cunninghams
43,at this stage they sat straight and alert
108,the circuit solicitor and another man atticus and tom robinson sat at tables with their backs to us
101,there was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the solicitors table atticuss was bare
122,just inside the railing that divided the spectators from the court the witnesses sat on cowhide bottomed chairs
23,their backs were to us
127,judge taylor was on the bench looking like a sleepy old shark his pilot fish writing rapidly below in front of him
287,judge taylor looked like most judges i had ever seen amiable whitehaired slightly ruddyfaced he was a man who ran his court with an alarming informality  he sometimes propped his feet up he often cleaned his fingernails with his pocket knife
253,in long equity hearings especially after dinner he gave the impression of dozing an impression dispelled forever when a lawyer once deliberately pushed a pile of books to the floor in a desperate effort to wake him up
124,without opening his eyes judge taylor murmured mr whitley do that again and itll cost you one hundred dollars
174, he was a man learned in the law and although he seemed to take his job casually in reality he kept a firm grip on any proceedings that came before him
115,only once was judge taylor ever seen at a dead standstill in open court and the cunninghams stopped him
151,old sarum their stamping grounds was populated by two families separate and apart in the beginning but unfortunately bearing the same name
195,the cunninghams married the coninghams until the spelling of the names was academic  academic until a cunningham disputed a coningham over land titles and took to the law
336,during a controversy of this character jeems cunningham testified that his mother spelled it cunningham on deeds and things but she was really a coningham she was an uncertain speller a seldom reader and was given to looking far away sometimes when she sat on the front gallery in the evening
136,after nine hours of listening to the eccentricities of old sarums inhabitants judge taylor threw the case out of court
178,when asked upon what grounds judge taylor said champertous connivance and declared he hoped to god the litigants were satisfied by each having had their public say
52,that was all they had wanted in the first place
41,judge taylor had one interesting habit
212,he permitted smoking in his courtroom but did not himself indulge sometimes if one was lucky one had the privilege of watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up
187,bit by bit the dead cigar would disappear to reappear some hours later as a flat slick mess its essence extracted and mingling with judge taylors digestive juices
99,i once asked atticus how mrs taylor stood to kiss him but atticus said they didnt kiss much
120,the witness stand was to the right of judge taylor and when we got to our seats mr heck tate was already on it
96,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  jem i said are those the ewells sittin down yonder
41, hush said jem mr heck tates testifyin
33, mr tate had dressed for the occasion
147,he wore an ordinary business suit which made him look somehow like every other man gone were his high boots lumber jacket and bulletstudded belt
42,from that moment he ceased to terrify me
139,he was sitting forward in the witness chair his hands clasped between his knees listening attentively to the circuit solicitor
54,the solicitor a mr gilmer was not well known to us
150,he was from abbottsville we saw him only when court convened and that rarely for court was of no special interest to jem and me
95,a balding smoothfaced man he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty
258,although his back was to us we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he used to his advantage he seemed to be looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind thus he was hell on juries and witnesses
111,the jury thinking themselves under close scrutiny paid attention so did the witnesses thinking likewise
53,in your own words mr tate mr gilmer was saying
127,well said mr tate touching his glasses and speaking to his knees i was called could you say it to the jury mr tate
15,who called you
93, mr tate said i was fetched by bob  by mr bob ewell yonder one night   what night sir
61, mr tate said it was the night of november twentyfirst
167,i was just leaving my office to go home when b  mr ewell came in very excited he was and said get out to his house quick some niggerd raped his girl
11, did you go
51,got in the car and went out as fast as i could
21, and what did you find
111, found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room one on the right as you go in
138,she was pretty well beat up but i heaved her to her feet and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right
230,i asked her who hurt her and she said it was tom robinson   judge taylor who had been concentrating on his fingernails looked up as if he were expecting an objection but atticus was quiet
62,  asked her if he beat her like that she said yes he had
66,asked her if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did
60,so i went down to robinsons house and brought him back
45,she identified him as the one so i took him in
25,thats all there was to it
27, thank you said mr gilmer
41,judge taylor said any questions atticus
18, yes said my father
148,he was sitting behind his table his chair was skewed to one side his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the back of his chair
33,did you call a doctor sheriff
26,did anybody call a doctor
14, asked atticus
19,no sir said mr tate
18,didnt call a doctor
24, no sir repeated mr tate
34, there was an edge to atticus s voice
36,well i can tell you why i didnt
27,it wasnt necessary mr finch
27,she was mighty banged up
39,something sho happened it was obvious
31, but you didnt call a doctor
70,while you were there did anyone send for one fetch one carry her to one
31, no sir judge taylor broke in
48,hes answered the question three times atticus
21,he didnt call a doctor
68, atticus said i just wanted to make sure judge and the judge smiled
74,jems hand which was resting on the balcony rail tightened around it
32,he drew in his breath suddenly
97,glancing below i saw no corresponding reaction and wondered if jem was trying to be dramatic
68,dill was watching peacefully and so was reverend sykes beside him
36, i whispered and got a terse shh
63, sheriff atticus was saying you say she was mighty banged up
11,in what way
40, well just describe her injuries heck
38, well she was beaten around the head
123,there was already bruises comin on her arms and it happened about thirty minutes before   how do you know
17, mr tate grinned
26,sorry thats what they said
86,anyway she was pretty bruised up when i got there and she had a black eye comin
56, mr tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair
100,lets see he said softly then he looked at atticus as if he considered the question childish
17,cant you remember
13, atticus asked
93,mr tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him and said her left
37, wait a minute sheriff said atticus
79,was it her left facing you or her left looking the same way you were
47, mr tate said oh yes thatd make it her right
31,it was her right eye mr finch
60,i remember now she was bunged up on that side of her face
83,mr tate blinked again as if something had suddenly been made plain to him
62,then he turned his head and looked around at tom robinson
52,as if by instinct tom robinson raised his head
79,something had been made plain to atticus also and it brought him to his feet
36,sheriff please repeat what you said
31, it was her right eye i said
98, atticus walked to the court reporters desk and bent down to the furiously scribbling hand
85,it stopped flipped back the shorthand pad and the court reporter said mr finch
60,i remember now she was bunged up on that side of the face
29, atticus looked up at mr tate
22,which side again heck
80, the right side mr finch but she had more bruises  you wanta hear about em
130, atticus seemed to be bordering on another question but he thought better of it and said yes what were her other injuries
129, as mr tate answered atticus turned and looked at tom robinson as if to say this was something they hadnt bargained for
51,her arms were bruised and she showed me her neck
76,there were definite finger marks on her gullet   all around her throat
27,at the back of her neck
34, id say they were all around mr
187, yes sir she had a small throat anybody coulda reached around it with   just answer the question yes or no please sheriff said atticus dryly and mr tate fell silent
175,atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor who shook his head at the judge who nodded to mr tate who rose stiffly and stepped down from the witness stand
139,below us heads turned feet scraped the floor babies were shifted to shoulders and a few children scampered out of the courtroom
168,the negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves dill was asking reverend sykes what it was all about but reverend sykes said he didnt know
191,so far things were utterly dull nobody had thundered there were no arguments between opposing counsel there was no drama a grave disappointment to all present it seemed
87,atticus was proceeding amiably as if he were involved in a title dispute
110,with his infinite capacity for calming turbulent seas he could make a rape case as dry as a sermon
153,gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard smells of sleepy eyed sullen men of a husky voice calling in the night mr finch
77, our nightmare had gone with daylight everything would come out all right
63,all the spectators were as relaxed as judge taylor except jem
188,his mouth was twisted into a purposeful halfgrin and his eyes happy about and he said something about corroborating evidence which made me sure he was showing off
16,robert e lee ewell
176, in answer to the clerks booming voice a little bantam cock of a man rose and strutted to the stand the back of his neck reddening at the sound of his name
89,when he turned around to take the oath we saw that his face was as red as his neck
46,we also saw no resemblance to his namesake
202,a shock of wispy new washed hair stood up from his forehead his nose was thin pointed and shiny he had no chin to speak of  it seemed to be part of his crepey neck
26,  so help me god he crowed
62,every town the size of maycomb had families like the ewells
171,no economic fluctuations changed their status  people like the ewells lived as guests of the county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a depression
222,no truant officers could keep their numerous offspring in school no public health officer could free them from congenital defects various worms and the diseases indigenous to filthy surroundings
89,maycomb s ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once a negro cabin
335,the cabins plank walls were supplemented with sheets of corrugated iron its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat so only its general shape suggested its original design square with four tiny rooms opening onto a shotgun hall the cabin rested uneasily upon four irregular lumps of limestone
218,its windows were merely open spaces in the walls which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on maycomb s refuse
507,the varmints had a lean time of it for the ewells gave the dump a thorough gleaning every day and the fruits of their industry those that were not eaten made the plot of ground around the cabin look like the playhouse of an insane child what passed for a fence was bits of treelimbs broomsticks and tool shafts all tipped with rusty hammerheads snaggletoothed rake heads shovels axes and grubbing hoes held on with pieces of barbed wire
318,enclosed by this barricade was a dirty yard containing the remains of a modelt ford on blocks a discarded dentists chair an ancient icebox plus lesser items old shoes wornout table radios picture frames and fruit jars under which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully
49,one corner of the yard though bewildered maycomb
258,against the fence in a line were six chippedenamel slop jars holding brilliant red geraniums cared for as tenderly as if they belonged to miss maudie atkinson had miss maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premises
37,people said they were mayella ewells
62,nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place
129,some people said six others said nine there were always several dirtyfaced ones at the windows when anyone passed by
229,nobody had occasion to pass by except at christmas when the churches delivered baskets and when the mayor of maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by dumping our own trees and trash
88,atticus took us with him last christmas when he complied with the mayors request
140,a dirt road ran from the highway past the dump down to a small negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the ewells
167,it was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of the road and turn around most people turned around in the negroes front yards
194,in the frosty december dusk their cabins looked neat and snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing amber from the fires inside
90,there were delicious smells about chicken bacon frying crisp as the twilight air
191,jem and i detected squirrel cooking but it took an old countryman like atticus to identify possum and rabbit aromas that vanished when we rode back past the ewell residence
184,all the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better than his nearest neighbors was that if scrubbed with lye soap in very hot water his skin was white
14,mr robert ewell
16, asked mr gilmer
37,thats mname capn said the witness
66,mr gilmers back stiffened a little and i felt sorry for him
41,perhaps id better explain something now
333,ive heard that lawyers children on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument get the wrong idea they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies of their parents they suffer agonies and are surprised to see them often go out arminarm with their tormenters during the first recess
33,this was not true of jem and me
63,we acquired no traumas from watching our father win or lose
91,im sorry that i cant provide any drama in this respect if i did it would not be true
150,we could tell however when debate became more acrimonious than professional but this was from watching lawyers other than our father
85,i never heard atticus raise his voice in my life except to a deaf witness
54,mr gilmer was doing his job as atticus was doing his
101,besides mr ewell was mr gilmers witness and he had no business being rude to him of all people
37,are you the father of mayella ewell
25, was the next question
79,well if i aint i cant do nothing about it now her mas dead was the answer
20,judge taylor stirred
83,he turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at the witness
38,are you the father of mayella ewell
71, he asked in a way that made the laughter below us stop suddenly
27,yes sir mr ewell said meekly
97,judge taylor went on in tones of good will this the first time youve ever been in court
37,i dont recall ever seeing you here
85, at the witnesss affirmative nod he continued well lets get something straight
132,there will be no more audibly obscene speculations on any subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as im sitting here
19,do you understand
43, mr ewell nodded but i dont think he did
45,judge taylor sighed and said all right mr
13, thank you sir
115,mr ewell would you tell us in your own words what happened on the evening of november twentyfirst please
41, jem grinned and pushed his hair back
51,justinyourown words was mr gilmers trademark
86,we often wondered who elses words mr gilmer was afraid his witness might employ
376,well the night of november twentyone i was comin in from the woods with a load okindlin and just as i got to the fence i heard mayella screamin like a stuck hog inside the house   here judge taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have decided his speculations devoid of evil intent for he subsided sleepily
20,what time was it mr
18, just fore sundown
119,well i was sayin mayella was screamin fit to beat jesus   another glance from the bench silenced mr ewell
20,she was screaming
15, said mr gilmer
43,mr ewell looked confusedly at the judge
221,well mayella was raisin this holy racket so i dropped mload and run as fast as i could but i run into th fence but when i got distangled i run up to th window and i seen   mr ewells face grew scarlet
55,he stood up and pointed his finger at tom robinson
55,  i seen that black nigger yonder ruttin on my mayella
135, so serene was judge taylors court that he had few occasions to use his gavel but he hammered fully five minutes
177,atticus was on his feet at the bench saying something to him mr heck tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom
71,behind us there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people
65,reverend sykes leaned across dill and me pulling at jems elbow
58,mr jem he said you better take miss jean louise home
18,mr jem you hear me
22, jem turned his head
13,scout go home
22,dill youn scout go home
75, you gotta make me first i said remembering atticus s blessed dictum
120,jem scowled furiously at me then said to reverend sykes i think its okay reverend she doesnt understand it
22, i was mortally offended
56,i most certainly do i cn understand anything you can
54,she doesnt understand it reverend she aint nine yet
44, reverend sykes s black eyes were anxious
32,mr finch know you all are here
58,this aint fit for miss jean louise or you boys either
19, jem shook his head
32,he cant see us this far away
22,its all right reverend
76, i knew jem would win because i knew nothing could make him leave now
90,dill and i were safe for a while atticus could see us from where he was if he looked
117,as judge taylor banged his gavel mr ewell was sitting smugly in the witness chair surveying his handiwork
292,with one phrase he had turned happy picknickers into a sulky tense murmuring crowd being slowly hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in the courtroom was a dim pinkpink pink the judge might have been rapping the bench with a pencil
83,in possession of his court once more judge taylor leaned back in his chair
177,he looked suddenly weary his age was showing and i thought about what atticus had said  he and mrs taylor didnt kiss much  he must have been nearly seventy
191,there has been a request judge taylor said that this courtroom be cleared of spectators or at least of women and children a request that will be denied for the time being
369,people generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for and they have the right to subject their children to it but i can assure you of one thing you will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this courtroom but you wont leave it until the whole boiling of you come before me on contempt charges
108,mr ewell you will keep your testimony within the confines of christian english usage if that is possible
36, mr ewell reminded me of a deafmute
156,i was sure he had never heard the words judge taylor directed at him  his mouth struggled silently with them  but their import registered on his face
214,smugness faded from it replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled judge taylor not at all as long as mr ewell was on the stand the judge kept his eyes on him as if daring him to make a false move
44,mr gilmer and atticus exchanged glances
105,atticus was sitting down again his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face
33,mr gilmer looked rather desperate
141,a question from judge taylor made him relax mr ewell did you see the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter
63, the spectators were quiet but the defendant said something
59,atticus whispered to him and tom robinson was silent
32,you say you were at the window
16, asked mr gilmer
31, how far is it from the ground
17, bout three foot
41, did you have a clear view of the room
22, how did the room look
54, well it was all slung about like there was a fight
47, what did you do when you saw the defendant
90, well i run around the house to get in but he run out the front door just ahead of me
31,i sawed who he was all right
54,i was too distracted about mayella to run after im
86,i run in the house and she was lyin on the floor squallin   then what did you do
35, why i run for tate quick as i could
107,i knowed who it was all right lived down yonder in that niggernest passed the house every day
203,jedge ive asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that nest down yonder theyre dangerous to live around sides devaluin my property   thank you mr ewell said mr gilmer hurriedly
117,the witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into atticus who had risen to question him
45,judge taylor permitted the court to laugh
42,just a minute sir said atticus genially
30,could i ask you a question or two
211, mr ewell backed up into the witness chair settled himself and regarded atticus with haughty suspicion an expression common to maycomb county witnesses when confronted by opposing counsel
77,mr ewell atticus began folks were doing a lot of running that night
128,lets see you say you ran to the house you ran to the window you ran inside you ran to mayella you ran for mr tate
56,did you during all this running run for a doctor
17, wadnt no need to
20,i seen what happened
57, but theres one thing i dont understand said atticus
47,werent you concerned with mayellas condition
40, i most positively was said mr ewell
18,i seen who done it
36, no i mean her physical condition
89,did you not think the nature of her injuries warranted immediate medical attention
58, didnt you think she should have had a doctor immediately
165, the witness said he never thought of it he had never called a doctor to any of hisn in his life and if he had it would have cost him five dollars
34,not quite said atticus casually
53,mr ewell you heard the sheriffs testimony didnt you
80, you were in the courtroom when mr heck tate was on the stand werent you
39,you heard everything he said didnt you
95, mr ewell considered the matter carefully and seemed to decide that the question was safe
12,yes he said
60,do you agree with his description of mayellas injuries
49, atticus looked around at mr gilmer and smiled
72,mr ewell seemed determined not to give the defense the time of day
117,mr tate testified that her right eye was blackened that she was beaten around the oh yeah said the witness
34,i hold with everything tate said
21, asked atticus mildly
27,i just want to make sure
311, he went to the court reporter said something and the reporter entertained us for some minutes by reading mr tates testimony as if it were stockmarket quotations which eye her left oh yes thatd make it her right it was her right eye mr finch i remember now she was bunged
19, he flipped the page
126,up on that side of the face sheriff please repeat what you said it was her right eye i said   thank you bert said atticus
28,you heard it again mr ewell
35,do you have anything to add to it
32,do you agree with the sheriff
20, i holds with tate
51,her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat up
84, the little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from the bench
68,it was becoming evident that he thought atticus an easy match
94,he seemed to grow ruddy again his chest swelled and once more he was a red little rooster
94,i thought hed burst his shirt at atticus s next question mr ewell can you read and write
24, mr gilmer interrupted
16,objection he said
82,cant see what witnesss literacy has to do with the case irrelevant n immaterial
123, judge taylor was about to speak but atticus said judge if youll allow the question plus another one youll soon see
73, all right lets see said judge taylor but make sure we see atticus
124, mr gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the state of mr ewells education had on the case
38,ill repeat the question said atticus
23,can you read and write
25, i most positively can
38, will you write your name and show us
24, i most positively will
43,how do you think i sign my relief checks
56, mr ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens
79,the whispers and chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was
22,i was becoming nervous
114,atticus seemed to know what he was doing  but it seemed to me that hed gone frogsticking without a light
151,never never never on crossexamination ask a witness a question you dont already know the answer to was a tenet i absorbed with my babyfood
92,do it and youll often get an answer you dont want an answer that might wreck your case
56,atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat
94,he drew out an envelope then reached into his vest pocket and undipped his fountain pen
86,he moved leisurely and had turned so that he was in full view of the jury
73,he unscrewed the fountainpen cap and placed it gently on his table
80,he shook the pen a little then handed it with the envelope to the witness
36,would you write your name for us
44,clearly now so the jury can see you do it
257, mr ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up complacently to see judge taylor staring at him as if he were some fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand to see mr gilmer halfsitting halfstanding at his table
93,the jury was watching him one man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing
18,whats so interestin
45,youre lefthanded mr ewell said judge taylor
205,mr ewell turned angrily to the judge and said he didnt see what his being lefthanded had to do with it that he was a christ fearing man and atticus finch was taking advantage of him
111,tricking lawyers like atticus finch took advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways
75,he had told them what happened hed say it again and again  which he did
155,nothing atticus asked him after that shook his story that hed looked through the window then ran the nigger off then ran for the sheriff
29,atticus finally dismissed him
39,mr gilmer asked him one more question
65,about your writing with your left hand are you ambidextrous mr
66, i most positively am not i can use one hand good as the other
69,one hand good as the other he added glaring at the defense table
34,jem seemed to be having a quiet fit
77,he was pounding the balcony rail softly and once he whispered weve got him
115, i didnt think so atticus was trying to show it seemed to me that mr ewell could have beaten up mayella
25,that much i could follow
153,if her right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face it would tend to show that a lefthanded person did it
44,sherlock holmes and jem finch would agree
50,but tom robinson could easily be lefthanded too
203,like mr heck tate i imagined a person facing me went through a swift mental pantomime and concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left
22,i looked down at him
77,his back was to us but i could see his broad shoulders and bullthick neck
29,he could easily have done it
43,i thought jem was counting his chickens
71,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  but someone was booming again
22,mayella violet ewell 
46, a young girl walked to the witness stand
356,as she raised her hand and swore that the evidence she gave would be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help her god she seemed somehow fragilelooking but when she sat facing us in the witness chair she became what she was a thickbodied girl accustomed to strenuous labor
285,in maycomb county it was easy to tell when someone bathed regularly as opposed to yearly lavations mr ewell had a scalded look as if an overnight soaking had deprived him of protective layers of dirt his skin appeared to be sensitive to the elements
123,mayella looked as if she tried to keep clean and i was reminded of the row of red geraniums in the ewell yard
176,mr gilmer asked mayella to tell the jury in her own words what happened on the evening of november twentyfirst of last year just in her own words please
18,mayella sat silently
41,where were you at dusk on that evening
27, began mr gilmer patiently
12,on the porch
12, which porch
32, aint but one the front porch
40, what were you doing on the porch
49, judge taylor said just tell us what happened
23,you can do that cant you
48, mayella stared at him and burst into tears
47,she covered her mouth with her hands and sobbed
78,judge taylor let her cry for a while then he said thats enough now
65,dont be fraid of anybody here as long as you tell the truth
102,all this is strange to you i know but youve nothing to be ashamed of and nothing to fear
22,what are you scared of
42, mayella said something behind her hands
14,what was that
17, asked the judge
30,him she sobbed pointing at atticus
106, she nodded vigorously saying dont want him doin me like he done papa tryin to make him out lefthanded
46, judge taylor scratched his thick white hair
81,it was plain that he had never been confronted with a problem of this kind
14,how old are you
29,nineteenandahalf mayella said
84,judge taylor cleared his throat and tried unsuccessfully to speak in soothing tones
85,mr finch has no idea of scaring you he growled and if he did im here to stop him
44,thats one thing im sitting up here for
104,now youre a big girl so you just sit up straight and tell the  tell us what happened to you
23,you can do that cant you
44, i whispered to jem has she got good sense
44, jem was squinting down at the witness stand
19,cant tell yet he said
96,shes got enough sense to get the judge sorry for her but she might be just  oh i dont know
399, mollified mayella gave atticus a final terrified glance and said to mr gilmer well sir i was on the porch and  and he came along and you see there was this old chiffarobe in the yard papad brought in to chop up for kindlin  papa told me to do it while he was off in the woods but i wadnt feelin strong enough then so he came by who is he
34, mayella pointed to tom robinson
61,ill have to ask you to be more specific please said mr gilmer
47,the reporter cant put down gestures very well
24, thatn yonder she said
20, then what happened
89, i said come here nigger and bust up this chiffarobe for me i gotta nickel for you
38,he coulda done it easy enough he could
130,so he come in the yard an i went in the house to get him the nickel and i turned around an fore i knew it he was on me
32,just run up behind me he did
108,he got me round the neck cussin me an sayin dirt  i foughtnhollered but he had me round the neck
238,he hit me agin an agin   mr gilmer waited for mayella to collect herself she had twisted her handkerchief into a sweaty rope when she opened it to wipe her face it was a mass of creases from her hot hands
148,she waited for mr gilmer to ask another question but when he didnt she said he chunked me on the floor an choked men took advantage of me
16, did you scream
17, asked mr gilmer
30,did you scream and fight back
85, reckon i did hollered for all i was worth kicked and hollered loud as i could
20, then what happened
134, i dont remember too good but next thing i knew papa was in the room astanding over me hollerin who done it who done it
128,then i sorta fainted an the next thing i knew mr tate was pullin me up offa the floor and leadin me to the water bucket
208, apparently mayellas recital had given her confidence but it was not her fathers brash kind there was something stealthy about hers like a steadyeyed cat with a twitchy tail
51,you say you fought him off as hard as you could
26,fought him tooth and nail
16, asked mr gilmer
42,i positively did mayella echoed her father
54,you are positive that he took full advantage of you
74, mayellas face contorted and i was afraid that she would cry again
46,instead she said he done what he was after
86, mr gilmer called attention to the hot day by wiping his head with his hand
76,thats all for the time being he said pleasantly but you stay there
60,i expect big bad mr finch has some questions to ask you
149, state will not prejudice the witness against counsel for the defense murmured judge taylor primly at least not at this time
200, atticus got up grinning but instead of walking to the witness stand he opened his coat and hooked his thumbs in his vest then he walked slowly across the room to the windows
129,he looked out but didnt seem especially interested in what he saw then he turned and strolled back to the witness stand
108,from long years of experience i could tell he was trying to come to a decision about something
77,miss mayella he said smiling i wont try to scare you for a while not yet
25,lets just get acquainted
14,how old are you
50, said i was nineteen said it to the judge yonder
56, mayella jerked her head resentfully at the bench
27,so you did so you did maam
115,youll have to bear with me miss mayella im getting along and cant remember as well as i used to
93,i might ask you things youve already said before but youll give me an answer wont you
133, i could see nothing in mayellas expression to justify atticuss assumption that he had secured her wholehearted cooperation
34,she was looking at him furiously
72,wont answer a word you say long as you keep on mockin me she said
24, asked atticus startled
34,longs you keep on makin fun ome
54, judge taylor said mr finch is not making fun of you
25,whats the matter with you
152, mayella looked from under lowered eyelids at atticus but she said to the judge longs he keeps on callin me maam an sayin miss mayella
65,i dont hafta take his sass i aint called upon to take it
85, atticus resumed his stroll to the windows and let judge taylor handle this one
127,judge taylor was not the kind of figure that ever evoked pity but i did feel a pang for him as he tried to explain
41,thats just mr finchs way he told mayella
104,weve done business in this court for years and years and mr finch is always courteous to everybody
56,hes not trying to mock you hes trying to be polite
18,thats just his way
23, the judge leaned back
143,atticus lets get on with these proceedings and let the record show that the witness has not been sassed her views to the contrary
140, i wondered if anybody had ever called her maam or miss mayella in her life probably not as she took offense to routine courtesy
31,what on earth was her life like
17,i soon found out
41,you say youre nineteen atticus resumed
41,how many sisters and brothers have you
47, he walked from the windows back to the stand
114,sebm she said and i wondered if they were all like the specimen i had seen the first day i started to school
14,you the eldest
36, how long has your mother been dead
22, dont know  long time
26, did you ever go to school
33, readnwrite good as papa yonder
66, mayella sounded like a mr jingle in a book i had been reading
29,how long did you go to school
29, two year  three year  dunno
274, slowly but surely i began to see the pattern of atticus s questions from questions that mr gilmer did not deem sufficiently irrelevant or immaterial to object to atticus was quietly building up before the jury a picture of the ewells home life
105,miss mayella said atticus in spite of himself a nineteenyearold girl like you must have friends
21,who are your friends
36, the witness frowned as if puzzled
61, yes dont you know anyone near your age or older or younger
15,boys and girls
22,just ordinary friends
80, mayellas hostility which had subsided to grudging neutrality flared again
27,you makin fun ome agin mr
76, atticus let her question answer his do you love your father miss mayella
13, was his next
22,love him whatcha mean
57, i mean is he good to you is he easy to get along with
44, he does tollable cept when   except when
96, mayella looked at her father who was sitting with his chair tipped against the railing
52,he sat up straight and waited for her to answer
34,except when nothin said mayella
24,i said he does tollable
29, mr ewell leaned back again
26,except when hes drinking
46, asked atticus so gently that mayella nodded
23,does he ever go after you
12, how you mean
41, when hes  riled has he ever beaten you
76, mayella looked around down at the court reporter up at the judge
57,answer the question miss mayella said judge taylor
78,my paws never touched a hair omy head in my life she declared firmly
19,he never touched me
82, atticuss glasses had slipped a little and he pushed them up on his nose
89,weve had a good visit miss mayella and now i guess wed better get to the case
65,you say you asked tom robinson to come chop up a  what was it
59, a chiffarobe a old dresser full of drawers on one side
37, was tom robinson well known to you
13, whaddya mean
51, i mean did you know who he was where he lived
17, mayella nodded
50,i knowed who he was he passed the house every day
65, was this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence
41, mayella jumped slightly at the question
148,atticus was making his slow pilgrimage to the windows as he had been doing he would ask a question then look out waiting for an answer
90,he did not see her involuntary jump but it seemed to me that he knew she had moved
43,he turned around and raised his eyebrows
21,was   he began again
64, didnt you ever ask him to come inside the fence before
22, she was prepared now
33,i did not i certainly did not
49, one did nots enough said atticus serenely
51,you never asked him to do odd jobs for you before
33, i mighta conceded mayella
34,there was several niggers around
43, can you remember any other occasions
35, all right now to what happened
88,you said tom robinson was behind you in the room when you turned around that right
82, you said he got you around the neck cussing and saying dirt  is that right
51, atticuss memory had suddenly become accurate
80,you say he caught me and choked me and took advantage of me  is that right
20, thats what i said
48, do you remember him beating you about the face
23, the witness hesitated
44,you seem sure enough that he choked you
46,all this time you were fighting back remember
50,you kicked and hollered as loud as you could
50, do you remember him beating you about the face
20, mayella was silent
59,she seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself
127,i thought for a moment she was doing mr heck tates and my trick of pretending there was a person in front of us
26,she glanced at mr gilmer
53,its an easy question miss mayella so ill try again
46,do you remember him beating you about the face
107, atticuss voice had lost its comfortableness he was speaking in his arid detached professional voice
46,do you remember him beating you about the face
33, no i dont recollect if he hit me
26,i mean yes i do he hit me
37, was your last sentence your answer
57,yes he hit  i just dont remember i just dont remember
23,it all happened so quick
38, judge taylor looked sternly at mayella
97,dont you cry young woman   he began but atticus said let her cry if she wants to judge
32,weve got all the time in the world
54, mayella sniffed wrathfully and looked at atticus
69,ill answer any question you got  get me up here an mock me will you
58,ill answer any question you got   thats fine said atticus
24,therere only a few more
160,miss mayella not to be tedious youve testified that the defendant hit you grabbed you around the neck choked you and took advantage of you
47,i want you to be sure you have the right man
39,will you identify the man who raped you
30, i will thats him right yonder
33, atticus turned to the defendant
12,tom stand up
48,let miss mayella have a good long look at you
27,is this the man miss mayella
71, tom robinsons powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt
78,he rose to his feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair
76,he looked oddly off balance but it was not from the way he was standing
100,his left arm was fully twelve inches shorter than his right and hung dead at his side
116,it ended in a small shriveled hand and from as far away as the balcony i could see that it was no use to him
14,scout breathed jem
22,reverend hes crippled
59, reverend sykes leaned across me and whispered to jem
105,he got it caught in a cotton gin caught it in mr dolphus raymonds cotton gin when he was a boy
22,like to bled to death
97,tore all the muscles loose from his bones   atticus said is this the man who raped you
23, it most certainly is
43, atticus s next question was one word long
19, mayella was raging
271,i dont know how he done it but he done it  i said it all happened so fast i   now lets consider this calmly   began atticus but mr gilmer interrupted with an objection he was not irrelevant or immaterial but atticus was browbeating the witness
29,judge taylor laughed outright
63,oh sit down horace hes doing nothing of the sort
47,if anything the witnesss browbeating atticus
66, judge taylor was the only person in the courtroom who laughed
112,even the babies were still and i suddenly wondered if they had been smothered at their mothers breasts
318,now said atticus miss mayella youve testified that the defendant choked and beat you  you didnt say that he sneaked up behind you and knocked you cold but you turned around and there he was   atticus was back behind his table and he emphasized his words by tapping his knuckles on it
54,  do you wish to reconsider any of your testimony
55, you want me to say something that didnt happen
54, no maam i want you to say something that did happen
43,tell us once more please what happened
24, i toldja what happened
58, you testified that you turned around and there he was
18,he choked you then
43, then he released your throat and hit you
16, i said he did
48, he blacked your left eye with his right fist
47, i ducked and it  it glanced thats what it did
26,i ducked and it glanced off
40, mayella had finally seen the light
49,youre becoming suddenly clear on this point
57,a while ago you couldnt remember too well could you
17, i said he hit me
60,he choked you he hit you then he raped you that right
22, it most certainly is
77, youre a strong girl what were you doing all the time just standing there
168, i toldja i hollerednkickednfought  atticus reached up and took off his glasses turned his good right eye to the witness and rained questions on her
52,judge taylor said one question at a time atticus
39,give the witness a chance to answer
32, all right why didnt you run
18, i tried tried to
19,what kept you from it
20, i  he slung me down
58,thats what he did he slung me downn got on top of me
35, you were screaming all this time
15, i certainly was
46, then why didnt the other children hear you
15,where were they
10,at the dump
17, where were they
50,why didnt your screams make them come running
41,the dumps closer than the woods isnt it
64,or didnt you scream until you saw your father in the window
46,you didnt think to scream until then did you
67,did you scream first at your father instead of at tom robinson
10,was that it
15,who beat you up
28,tom robinson or your father
95,what did your father see in the window the crime of rape or the best defense to it
68,why dont you tell the truth child didnt bob ewell beat you up
134, when atticus turned away from mayella he looked like his stomach hurt but mayellas face was a mixture of terror and fury
80,atticus sat down wearily and polished his glasses with his handkerchief
37,suddenly mayella became articulate
33,i got somethin to say she said
22,atticus raised his head
38,do you want to tell us what happened
58, but she did not hear the compassion in his invitation
57,i got somethin to say an then i aint gonna say no more
208,that nigger yonder took advantage of me an if you fine fancy gentlemen dont wanta do nothin about it then youre all yellow stinkin cowards stinkin cowards the lot of you
151,your fancy airs dont come to nothin  your maamin and miss mayellerin dont come to nothin mr finch then she burst into real tears
38,her shoulders shook with angry sobs
28,she was as good as her word
98,she answered no more questions even when mr gilmer tried to get her back on the track
182,i guess if she hadnt been so poor and ignorant judge taylor would have put her under the jail for the contempt she had shown everybody in the courtroom
111,somehow atticus had hit her hard in a way that was not clear to me but it gave him no pleasure to do so
170,he sat with his head down and i never saw anybody glare at anyone with the hatred mayella showed when she left the stand and walked by atticus s table
100,when mr gilmer told judge taylor that the state rested judge taylor said its time we all did
20,well take ten minutes
185, atticus and mr gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered then they left the courtroom by a door behind the witness stand which was a signal for us all to stretch
101,i discovered that i had been sitting on the edge of the long bench and i was somewhat numb
95,jem got up and yawned dill did likewise and reverend sykes wiped his face on his hat
46,the temperature was an easy ninety he said
242,mr braxton underwood who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the press soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain allowed his bitter eyes to rove over the colored balcony and they met mine
33,he gave a snort and looked away
39,jem i said mr underwoods seen us
10, thats okay
82,he wont tell atticus hell just put it on the social side of the tribune
129, jem turned back to dill explaining i suppose the finer points of the trial to him but i wondered what they were
228,there had been no lengthy debates between atticus and mr gilmer on any points mr gilmer seemed to be prosecuting almost reluctantly witnesses had been led by the nose as asses are with few objections
189,but atticus had once told us that in judge taylors court any lawyer who was a strict constructionist on evidence usually wound up receiving strict instructions from the bench
168,he distilled this for me to mean that judge taylor might look lazy and operate in his sleep but he was seldom reversed and that was the proof of the pudding
34,atticus said he was a good judge
71,presently judge taylor returned and climbed into his swivel chair
69,he took a cigar from his vest pocket and examined it thoughtfully
16,i punched dill
76,having passed the judges inspection the cigar suffered a vicious bite
49,we come down sometimes to watch him i explained
54,its gonna take him the rest of the afternoon now
146, unaware of public scrutiny from above judge taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying fhluck
54, he hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh
49,bet he was hell with a spitball murmured dill
74,as a rule a recess meant a general exodus but today people werent moving
119,even the idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had remained standing along the walls
80,i guess mr heck tate had reserved the county toilet for court officials
71,atticus and mr gilmer returned and judge taylor looked at his watch
131,its gettin on to four he said which was intriguing as the courthouse clock must have struck the hour at least twice
44,i had not heard it or felt its vibrations
40,shall we try to wind up this afternoon
19, asked judge taylor
19,how bout it atticus
29, i think we can said atticus
28,how many witnesses you got
14, well call him
126, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  thomas robinson reached around ran his fingers under his left arm and lifted it
108,he guided his arm to the bible and his rubberlike left hand sought contact with the black binding
96,as he raised his right hand the useless one slipped off the bible and hit the clerks table
64,he was trying again when judge taylor growled thatll do tom
55, tom took the oath and stepped into the witness chair
222,atticus very quickly induced him to tell us tom was twentyfive years of age he was married with three children he had been in trouble with the law before he once received thirty days for disorderly conduct
47,it must have been disorderly said atticus
24,what did it consist of
58, got in a fight with another man he tried to cut me
16, did he succeed
39, yes suh a little not enough to hurt
42,you see i   tom moved his left shoulder
16,yes said atticus
24,you were both convicted
56, yes suh i had to serve cause i couldnt pay the fine
24,other fellow paid hisn
59, dill leaned across me and asked jem what atticus was doing
70,jem said atticus was showing the jury that tom had nothing to hide
49,were you acquainted with mayella violet ewell
14, asked atticus
75,yes suh i had to pass her place goin to and from the field every day
12, whose field
26, i picks for mr link deas
38, were you picking cotton in november
50, no suh i works in his yard fall an wintertime
90,i works pretty steady for him all year round hes got a lot of pecan treesn things
68, you say you had to pass the ewell place to get to and from work
28,is there any other way to go
24, no suh nones i know of
32, tom did she ever speak to you
137, why yes suh id tip mhat when id go by and one day she asked me to come inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for her
59, when did she ask you to chop up the  the chiffarobe
33, mr finch it was way last spring
71,i remember it because it was choppin time and i had my hoe with me
74,i said i didnt have nothin but this hoe but she said she had a hatchet
55,she give me the hatchet and i broke up the chiffarobe
57,she said t reckon ill hafta give you a nickel wont i
38, an i said no maam there aint no charge
18, then i went home
57,mr finch that was way last spring way over a year ago
37, did you ever go on the place again
28, well i went lots of times
78, judge taylor instinctively reached for his gavel but let his hand fall
41,the murmur below us died without his help
26,under what circumstances
11, please suh
51, why did you go inside the fence lots of times
34, tom robinsons forehead relaxed
22,shed call me in suh
148,seemed like every time i passed by yonder shed have some little somethin for me to do  choppin kindlin totin water for her
79,she watered them red flowers every day   were you paid for your services
60, no suh not after she offered me a nickel the first time
138,i was glad to do it mr ewell didnt seem to help her none and neither did the chillun and i knowed she didnt have no nickels to spare
32, where were the other children
43, they was always around all over the place
68,theyd watch me work some of em some of emd set in the window
33, would miss mayella talk to you
26, yes sir she talked to me
133, as tom robinson gave his testimony it came to me that mayella ewell must have been the loneliest person in the world
104,she was even lonelier than boo radley who had not been out of the house in twentyfive years
133,when atticus asked had she any friends she seemed not to know what he meant then she thought he was making fun of her
227,she was as sad i thought as what jem called a mixed child white people wouldnt have anything to do with her because she lived among pigs negroes wouldnt have anything to do with her because she was white
160,she couldnt live like mr dolphus raymond who preferred the company of negroes because she didnt own a riverbank and she wasnt from a fine old family
51,nobody said thats just their way about the ewells
82,maycomb gave them christmas baskets welfare money and the back of its hand
77,tom robinson was probably the only person who was ever decent to her
125,but she said he took advantage of her and when she stood up she looked at him as if he were dirt beneath her feet
198,did you ever atticus interrupted my meditations at any time go on the ewell property  did you ever set foot on the ewell property without an express invitation from one of them
29, no suh mr finch i never did
24,i wouldnt do that suh
345, atticus sometimes said that one way to tell whether a witness was lying or telling the truth was to listen rather than watch i applied his test  tom denied it three times in one breath but quietly with no hint of whining in his voice and i found myself believing him in spite of his protesting too much
126,he seemed to be a respectable negro and a respectable negro would never go up into somebodys yard of his own volition
80,tom what happened to you on the evening of november twentyfirst of last year
76, below us the spectators drew a collective breath and leaned forward
36,behind us the negroes did the same
62,tom was a blackvelvet negro not shiny but soft black velvet
97,the whites of his eyes shone in his face and when he spoke we saw flashes of his teeth
69,if he had been whole he would have been a fine specimen of a man
157,mr finch he said i was goin home as usual that evenin an when i passed the ewell place miss mayella were on the porch like she said she were
56,it seemed real quiet like an i didnt quite know why
97,i was studyin why just passin by when she says for me to come there and help her a minute
168,well i went inside the fence an looked around for some kindlin to work on but i didnt see none and she says naw i got somethin for you to do in the house
61,th old doors off its hinges an falls comin on pretty fast
45, i said you got a screwdriver miss mayella
20,she said she sho had
117,well i went up the steps an she motioned me to come inside and i went in the front room an looked at the door
50,i said miss mayella this door look all right
59,i pulled it backn forth and those hinges was all right
30,then she shet the door in my face
181,mr finch i was wonderin why it was so quiet like an it come to me that there werent a chile on the place not a one of em and i said miss mayella where the chillun
82, toms black velvet skin had begun to shine and he ran his hand over his face
22,i say where the chillun
109, he continued an she says  she was laughin sort of  she says they all gone to town to get ice creams
69,she says took me a slap year to save sebm nickels but i done it
24,they all gone to town
48, toms discomfort was not from the humidity
25,what did you say then tom
13, asked atticus
79,i said somethin like why miss mayella thats right smart oyou to treat em
25,an she said you think so
143, i dont think she understood what i was thinkin  i meant it was smart of her to save like that an nice of her to treat em
22, i understand you tom
19,go on said atticus
229,well i said i best be goin i couldnt do nothin for her an she says oh yes i could an i ask her what and she says to just step on that chair yonder an git that box down from on top of the chiffarobe
39, not the same chiffarobe you busted up
13, asked atticus
18,the witness smiled
18,naw suh another one
23,most as tall as the room
161,so i done what she told me an i was just reachin when the next thing i knows she  shed grabbed me round the legs grabbed me round th legs mr finch
160,she scared me so bad i hopped down an turned the chair over  that was the only thing only furniture sturbed in that room mr finch when i left it
17,i swear fore god
47, what happened after you turned the chair over
38, tom robinson had come to a dead stop
91,he glanced at atticus then at the jury then at mr underwood sitting across the room
41,tom youre sworn to tell the whole truth
16,will you tell it
43, tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth
26,what happened after that
39, answer the question said judge taylor
35,onethird of his cigar had vanished
92,mr finch i got down offa that chair an turned around an she sorta jumped on me
14, jumped on you
26, no suh she  she hugged me
30,she hugged me round the waist
121, this time judge taylors gavel came down with a bang and as it did the overhead lights went on in the courtroom
66,darkness had not come but the afternoon sun had left the windows
36,judge taylor quickly restored order
18,then what did she do
31, the witness swallowed hard
43,she reached up an kissed me side of th face
85,she says she never kissed a grown man before an she might as well kiss a nigger
46,she says what her papa do to her dont count
30,she says kiss me back nigger
119, i say miss mayella lemme outa here an tried to run but she got her back to the door an fda had to push her
130,i didnt wanta harm her mr finch an i say lemme pass but just when i say it mr ewell yonder hollered through th window
17, what did he say
56, tom robinson swallowed again and his eyes widened
100,somethin not fittin to say  not fittin for these folks n chillun to hear   what did he say tom
37,you must tell the jury what he said
34, tom robinson shut his eyes tight
46,he says you goddamn whore ill kill ya
19, then what happened
63, mr finch i was runnin so fast i didnt know what happened
32, tom did you rape mayella ewell
14, i did not suh
29, did you harm her in any way
15, i did not suh
30, did you resist her advances
17, mr finch i tried
37,i tried to thout bein ugly to her
58,i didnt wanta be ugly i didnt wanta push her or nothin
96, it occurred to me that in their own way tom robinsons manners were as good as atticuss
281,until my father explained it to me later i did not understand the subtlety of toms predicament he would not have dared strike a white woman under any circumstances and expect to live long so he took the first opportunity to run  a sure sign of guilt
48,tom go back once more to mr ewell said atticus
27,did he say anything to you
18, not anything suh
86,he mighta said somethin but i werent there   thatll do atticus cut in sharply
39,what you did hear who was he talking to
54, mr finch he were talkin and lookin at miss mayella
13, then you ran
14, i sho did suh
16, why did you run
15, i was scared suh
20, why were you scared
60, mr finch if you was a nigger like me youd be scared too
17, atticus sat down
205,mr gilmer was making his way to the witness stand but before he got there mr link deas rose from the audience and announced i just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now
77,that boys worked for me eight years an i aint had a speck otrouble outa him
12,not a speck
21, shut your mouth sir
43, judge taylor was wide awake and roaring
29,he was also pink in the face
52,his speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar
178,link deas he yelled if you have anything you want to say you can say it under oath and at the proper time but until then you get out of this room you hear me
38,get out of this room sir you hear me
50,ill be damned if ill listen to this case again
135, judge taylor looked daggers at atticus as if daring him to speak but atticus had ducked his head and was laughing into his lap
174,i remembered something he had said about judge taylors ex cathedra remarks sometimes exceeding his duty but that few lawyers ever did anything about them
41,i looked at jem but jem shook his head
70,it aint like one of the jurymen got up and started talking he said
30,i think itd be different then
49,mr link was just disturbin the peace or something
239, judge taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written down after mr finch if you were a nigger like me youd be scared too and told the jury to disregard the interruption
124,he looked suspiciously down the middle aisle and waited i suppose for mr link deas to effect total departure
25,then he said go ahead mr
71, you were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct robinson
18, asked mr gilmer
60, whatd the nigger look like when you got through with him
14, he beat me mr
39, yes but you were convicted werent you
27, atticus raised his head
48,it was a misdemeanor and its in the record judge
28, i thought he sounded tired
63,witnessll answer though said judge taylor just as wearily
26,yes suh i got thirty days
243, i knew that mr gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take advantage of mayella ewell that was the only reason he cared
27,reasons like that helped
100,robinson youre pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one hand arent you
19, yes suh i reckon so
81, strong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor
23, i never done that suh
30, but you are strong enough to
16, i reckon so suh
49, had your eye on her a long time hadnt you boy
31, no suh i never looked at her
93, then you were mighty polite to do all that chopping and hauling for her werent you boy
41, i was just tryin to help her out suh
92, that was mighty generous of you you had chores at home after your regular work didnt you
52, why didnt you do them instead of miss ewells
20, i done em both suh
33, you must have been pretty busy
13, why what suh
53, why were you so anxious to do that womans chores
53, tom robinson hesitated searching for an answer
122,looked like she didnt have nobody to help her like i says   with mr ewell and seven children on the place boy
123, well i says it looked like they never help her none   you did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness boy
26, tried to help her i says
39, mr gilmer smiled grimly at the jury
68,youre a mighty good fellow it seems  did all this for not one penny
123,i felt right sorry for her she seemed to try moren the rest of em   you felt sorry for her you felt sorry for he
51, mr gilmer seemed ready to rise to the ceiling
68,the witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair
24,but the damage was done
46,below us nobody liked tom robinsons answer
50,mr gilmer paused a long time to let it sink in
135,now you went by the house as usual last november twentyfirst he said and she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe
47, do you deny that you went by the house
138, no suh  she said she had somethin for me to do inside the house   she says she asked you to bust up a chiffarobe is that right
17, no suh it aint
28, then you say shes lying boy
64, atticus was on his feet but tom robinson didnt need him
70,i dont say shes lyin mr gilmer i say shes mistaken in her mind
165, to the next ten questions as mr gilmer reviewed mayellas version of events the witnesss steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind
40,didnt mr ewell run you off the place boy
27, no suh i dont think he did
28, dont think what do you mean
62, i mean i didnt stay long enough for him to run me off
57, youre very candid about this why did you run so fast
23, i says i was scared suh
52, if you had a clear conscience why were you scared
80, like i says before it werent safe for any nigger to be in a  fix like that
80, but you werent in a fix  you testified that you were resisting miss ewell
65,were you so scared that shed hurt you you ran a big buck like you
56, no suh fs scared id be in court just like i am now
64, scared of arrest scared youd have to face up to what you did
52, no suh scared id hafta face up to what i didnt do
34, are you being impudent to me boy
25, no suh i didnt go to be
103, this was as much as i heard of mr gilmers crossexamination because jem made me take dill out
146,for some reason dill had started crying and couldnt stop quietly at first then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony
93,jem said if i didnt go with him hed make me and reverend sykes said id better go so i went
135,dill had seemed to be all right that day nothing wrong with him but i guessed he hadnt fully recovered from running away
23,aint you feeling good
49, i asked when we reached the bottom of the stairs
73,dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps
49,mr link deas was a lonely figure on the top step
24,anything happenin scout
24, he asked as we went by
34,no sir i answered over my shoulder
18,dill here hes sick
36, come on out under the trees i said
21,heat got you i expect
56, we chose the fattest live oak and we sat under it
46,it was just him i couldnt stand dill said
90, that old mr gilmer doin him thataway talking so hateful to him   dill thats his job
88,why if we didnt have prosecutors  well we couldnt have defense attorneys i reckon
22, dill exhaled patiently
22,i know all that scout
52,it was the way he said it made me sick plain sick
129, hes supposed to act that way dill he was cross   he didnt act that way when   dill those were his own witnesses
95, well mr finch didnt act that way to mayella and old man ewell when he cross examined them
181,the way that man called him boy all the time an sneered at him an looked around at the jury every time he answered   well dill after all hes just a negro
24, i dont care one speck
60,it aint right somehow it aint right to do em that way
76,hasnt anybody got any business talkin like that  it just makes me sick
58, thats just mr gilmers way dill he does em all that way
47,youve never seen him get goodn down on one yet
76,why when  well today mr gilmer seemed to me like he wasnt half trying
49,they do em all that way most lawyers i mean
16, mr finch doesnt
118, hes not an example dill hes   i was trying to grope in my memory for a sharp phrase of miss maudie atkinsons
75,i had it hes the same in the courtroom as he is on the public streets
33, thats not what i mean said dill
45,i know what you mean boy said a voice behind us
81,we thought it came from the treetrunk but it belonged to mr dolphus raymond
35,he peered around the trunk at us
55,you arent thinhided it just makes you sick doesnt it
108, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  come on round here son i got something thatll settle your stomach
104, as mr dolphus raymond was an evil man i accepted his invitation reluctantly but i followed dill
125,somehow i didnt think atticus would like it if we became friendly with mr raymond and i knew aunt alexandra wouldnt
67,here he said offering dill his paper sack with straws in it
34,take a good sip itll quieten you
54, dill sucked on the straws smiled and pulled at length
78,hee hee said mr raymond evidently taking delight in corrupting a child
33,dill you watch out now i warned
37,dill released the straws and grinned
32,scout its nothing but cocacola
45, mr raymond sat up against the treetrunk
32,he had been lying on the grass
48,you little folks wont tell on me now will you
36,itd ruin my reputation if you did
50, you mean all you drink in that sacks cocacola
21,just plain cocacola
29, yes maam mr raymond nodded
66,i liked his smell it was of leather horses cottonseed
57,he wore the only english riding boots i had ever seen
36,thats all i drink most of the time
34, then you just pretend youre half  
42,i beg your pardon sir i caught myself
146,i didnt mean to be   mr raymond chuckled not at all offended and i tried to frame a discreet question why do you do like you do
38, wh  oh yes you mean why do i pretend
29,well its very simple he said
41,some folks dont  like the way i live
74,now i could say the hell with em i dont care if they dont like it
99,i do say i dont care if they dont like it right enough  but i dont say the hell with em see
25, dill and i said no sir
31, i try to give em a reason you see
50,it helps folks if they can latch onto a reason
198,when i come to town which is seldom if i weave a little and drink out of this sack folks can say dolphus raymonds in the clutches of whiskey  thats why he wont change his ways
59,he cant help himself thats why he lives the way he does
131, that aint honest mr raymond making yourself out baddern you are already it aint honest but its mighty helpful to folks
163,secretly miss finch im not much of a drinker but you see they could never never understand that i live like i do because thats the way i want to live
159, i had a feeling that i shouldnt be here listening to this sinful man who had mixed children and didnt care who knew it but he was fascinating
84,i had never encountered a being who deliberately perpetrated fraud against himself
53,but why had he entrusted us with his deepest secret
15,i asked him why
174,because youre children and you can understand it he said and because i heard that one   he jerked his head at dill things havent caught up with that ones instinct yet
58,let him get a little older and he wont get sick and cry
117,maybe thingsll strike him as being  not quite right say but he wont cry not when he gets a few years on him
19, cry about what mr
48, dills maleness was beginning to assert itself
81,cry about the simple hell people give other people  without even thinking
118,cry about the hell white people give colored folks without even stopping to think that theyre people too
97, atticus says cheatin a colored man is ten times worse than cheatin a white man i muttered
36,says its the worst thing you can do
206, mr raymond said i dont reckon its  miss jean louise you dont know your pas not a runofthemill man itll take a few years for that to sink in  you havent seen enough of the world yet
100,you havent even seen this town but all you gotta do is step back inside the courthouse
93, which reminded me that we were missing nearly all of mr gilmers cross examination
102,i looked at the sun and it was dropping fast behind the storetops on the west side of the square
123,between two fires i could not decide which i wanted to jump into mr raymond or the th judicial circuit court
15,cmon dill i said
18,you all right now
93,glad tve metcha mr raymond and thanks for the drink it was mighty settlin
122, we raced back to the courthouse up the steps up two flights of stairs and edged our way along the balcony rail
37,reverend sykes had saved our seats
73,the courtroom was still and again i wondered where the babies were
217,judge taylors cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth mr gilmer was writing on one of the yellow pads on his table trying to outdo the court reporter whose hand was jerking rapidly
33,shoot i muttered we missed it
55, atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury
122,he had evidently pulled some papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair because they were on his table
35,tom robinson was toying with them
119,absence of any corroborative evidence this man was indicted on a capital charge and is now on trial for his life
14, i punched jem
26,how longs he been at it
72, hes just gone over the evidence jem whispered and were gonna win scout
22,i dont see how we cant
30,hes been at it bout five minutes
76,he made it as plain and easy as  well as ida explained it to you
32,you could ve understood it even
27,nothing new just the usual
22, we looked down again
98,atticus was speaking easily with the kind of detachment he used when he dictated a letter
200,he walked slowly up and down in front of the jury and the jury seemed to be attentive their heads were up and they followed atticus s route with what seemed to be appreciation
51,i guess it was because atticus wasnt a thunderer
61,atticus paused then he did something he didnt ordinarily do
333,he unhitched his watch and chain and placed them on the table saying with the courts permission   judge taylor nodded and then atticus did something i never saw him do before or since in public or in private he unbuttoned his vest unbuttoned his collar loosened his tie and took off his coat
181,he never loosened a scrap of his clothing until he undressed at bedtime and to jem and me this was the equivalent of him standing before us stark naked
31,we exchanged horrified glances
168,atticus put his hands in his pockets and as he returned to the jury i saw his gold collar button and the tips of his pen and pencil winking in the light
17,gentlemen he said
72,jem and i again looked at each other atticus might have said scout
140, his voice had lost its aridity its detachment and he was talking to the jury as if they were folks on the post office corner
319,gentlemen he was saying i shall be brief but i would like to use my remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one it requires no minute sifting of complicated facts but it does require you to be sure beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant
64,to begin with this case should never have come to trial
43,this case is as simple as black and white
148,the state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the crime tom robinson is charged with ever took place
212,it has relied instead upon the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into serious question on crossexamination but has been flatly contradicted by the defendant
63,the defendant is not guilty but somebody in this courtroom is
230,i have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state but my pity does not extend so far as to her putting a mans life at stake which she has done in an effort to get rid of her own guilt
66,i say guilt gentlemen because it was guilt that motivated her
203,she has committed no crime she has merely broken a rigid and timehonored code of our society a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with
88,she is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance but i cannot pity her she is white
165,she knew full well the enormity of her offense but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking she persisted in breaking it
115,she persisted and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another
119,she did something every child has done  she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her
209,but in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband she struck out at her victim  of necessity she must put him away from her  he must be removed from her presence from this world
49,she must destroy the evidence of her offense
40,what was the evidence of her offense
28,tom robinson a human being
40,she must put tom robinson away from her
57,tom robinson was her daily reminder of what she did
15,what did she do
19,she tempted a negro
41,she was white and she tempted a negro
82,she did something that in our society is unspeakable she kissed a black man
47,not an old uncle but a strong young negro man
103,no code mattered to her before she broke it but it came crashing down on her afterwards
69,her father saw it and the defendant has testified as to his remarks
23,what did her father do
165,we dont know but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that mayella ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with his left
333,we do know in part what mr ewell did he did what any godfearing persevering respectable white man would do under the circumstances  he swore out a warrant no doubt signing it with his left hand and tom robinson now sits before you having taken the oath with the only good hand he possesses  his right hand
167,and so a quiet respectable humble negro who had the unmitigated temerity to feel sorry for a white woman has had to put his word against two white peoples
113,i need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand  you saw them for yourselves
543,the witnesses for the state with the exception of the sheriff of maycomb county have presented themselves to you gentlemen to this court in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption  the evil assumption  that all negroes lie that all negroes are basically immoral beings that all negro men are not to be trusted around our women an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber
120,which gentlemen we know is in itself a lie as black as tom robinsons skin a lie i do not have to point out to you
170,you know the truth and the truth is this some negroes lie some negroes are immoral some negro men are not to be trusted around women  black or white
89,but this is a truth that applies to the human race and to no particular race of men
190,there is not a person in this courtroom who has never told a lie who has never done an immoral thing and there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire
46, atticus paused and took out his handkerchief
194,then he took off his glasses and wiped them and we saw another first we had never seen him sweat  he was one of those men whose faces never perspired but now it was shining tan
41,one more thing gentlemen before i quit
189,thomas jefferson once said that all men are created equal a phrase that the yankees and the distaff side of the executive branch in washington are fond of hurling at us
133,there is a tendency in this year of grace  for certain people to use this phrase out of context to satisfy all conditions
307,the most ridiculous example i can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious  because all men are created equal educators will gravely tell you the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority
358,we know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe  some people are smarter than others some people have more opportunity because theyre born with it some men make more money than others some ladies make better cakes than others  some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men
271,but there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal  there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a rockefeller the stupid man the equal of an einstein and the ignorant man the equal of any college president
40,that institution gentlemen is a court
142,it can be the supreme court of the united states or the humblest jp court in the land or this honorable court which you serve
172,our courts have their faults as does any human institution but in this country our courts are the great levelers and in our courts all men are created equal
161,im no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system  that is no ideal to me it is a living working reality
88,gentlemen a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury
98,a court is only as sound as its jury and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up
167,i am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard come to a decision and restore this defendant to his family
33,in the name of god do your duty
107, atticuss voice had dropped and as he turned away from the jury he said something i did not catch
49,he said it more to himself than to the court
13,i punched jem
11,whatd he say
66, tn the name of god believe him i think thats what he said
55, dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at jem
12,looka yonder
47, we followed his finger with sinking hearts
90,calpurnia was making her way up the middle aisle walking straight toward atticus
124,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  she stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get judge taylors attention
66,she was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand
58,judge taylor saw her and said its calpurnia isnt it
19, yes sir she said
54,could i just pass this note to mr finch please sir
56,it hasnt got anything to do with  with the trial
70, judge taylor nodded and atticus took the envelope from calpurnia
82,he opened it read its contents and said judge i  this note is from my sister
63,she says my children are missing havent turned up since noon
41,could you   i know where they are atticus
23, mr underwood spoke up
134,theyre right up yonder in the colored balcony  been there since precisely oneeighteen pm our father turned around and looked up
37,jem come down from there he called
57,then he said something to the judge we didnt hear
70,we climbed across reverend sykes and made our way to the staircase
41,atticus and calpurnia met us downstairs
55,calpurnia looked peeved but atticus looked exhausted
30,jem was jumping in excitement
19,weve won havent we
35, ive no idea said atticus shortly
28,youve been here all afternoon
58,go home with calpurnia and get your supper  and stay home
43, aw atticus let us come back pleaded jem
41,please let us hear the verdict please sir
110, the jury might be out and back in a minute we dont know   but we could tell atticus was relenting
64,well youve heard it all so you might as well hear the rest
185,tell you what you all can come back when youve eaten your supper  eat slowly now you wont miss anything important  and if the jurys still out you can wait with us
46,but i expect itll be over before you get back
40, you think theyll acquit him that fast
66,atticus opened his mouth to answer but shut it and left us
219,i prayed that reverend sykes would save our seats for us but stopped praying when i remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was out  tonight theyd overrun the drugstore the ok
82,cafe and the hotel that is unless they had brought their suppers too
114,calpurnia marched us home   skin every one of you alive the very idea you children listenin to all that
82,mister jem dont you know bettern to take your little sister to that trial
82,miss alexandrall absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she finds out
35,aint fittin for children to hear
114, the streetlights were on and we glimpsed calpurnias indignant profile as we passed beneath them
122,mister jem i thought you was gettin some kinda head on your shoulders  the very idea shes your little sister
17,the very idea sir
82,you oughta be perfectly ashamed of yourself  aint you got any sense at all
18, i was exhilarated
209,so many things had happened so fast i felt it would take years to sort them out and now here was calpurnia giving her precious jem down the country  what new marvels would the evening bring
17,jem was chuckling
34,dont you want to hear about it cal
20, hush your mouth sir
274,when you oughta be hangin your head in shame you go along laughin   calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved jem to little remorse and she sailed up the front steps with her classic if mr finch dont wear you out i will  get in that house sir
100, jem went in grinning and calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having dill in to supper
85,you all call miss rachel right now and tell her where you are she told him
125,shes run distracted lookin for you  you watch out she dont ship you back to meridian first thing in the mornin
85, aunt alexandra met us and nearly fainted when calpurnia told her where we were
116,i guess it hurt her when we told her atticus said we could go back because she didnt say a word during supper
119,she just rearranged food on her plate looking at it sadly while calpurnia served jem dill and me with a vengeance
130,calpurnia poured milk dished out potato salad and ham muttering shamed of yourselves in varying degrees of intensity
44,now you all eat slow was her final command
35,reverend sykes had saved our places
319,we were surprised to find that we had been gone nearly an hour and were equally surprised to find the courtroom exactly as we had left it with minor changes the jury box was empty the defendant was gone judge taylor had been gone but he reappeared as we were seating ourselves
31,nobodys moved hardly said jem
68,they moved around some when the jury went out said reverend sykes
83,the menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers and they fed their babies
29, how long have they been out
20,bout thirty minutes
88,mr finch and mr gilmer did some more talkin and judge taylor charged the jury
11, how was he
24,oh he did right well
55,i aint complainin one bit  he was mighty fair minded
145,he sorta said if you believe this then youll have to return one verdict but if you believe this youll have to return another one
80,i thought he was leanin a little to our side   reverend sykes scratched his head
85,hes not supposed to lean reverend but dont fret weve won it he said wisely
182,dont see how any jury could convict on what we heard   now dont you be so confident mr jem i aint ever seen any jury decide in favor of a colored man over a white man
271, but jem took exception to reverend sykes and we were subjected to a lengthy review of the evidence with jems ideas on the law regarding rape it wasnt rape if she let you but she had to be eighteen  in alabama that is  and mayella was nineteen
123,apparently you had to kick and holler you had to be overpowered and stomped on preferably knocked stone cold
66,if you were under eighteen you didnt have to go through all this
151,mr jem reverend sykes demurred this aint a polite thing for little ladies to hear aw she doesnt know what were talkin about said jem
40,scout this is too old for you aint it
61, it most certainly is not i know every word youre saying
91, perhaps i was too convincing because jem hushed and never discussed the subject again
23,what time is it reverend
24,gettin on toward eight
177, i looked down and saw atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets he made a tour of the windows then walked by the railing over to the jury box
93,he looked in it inspected judge taylor on his throne then went back to where he started
35,i caught his eye and waved to him
60,he acknowledged my salute with a nod and resumed his tour
69,mr gilmer was standing at the windows talking to mr underwood
83,bert the court reporter was chainsmoking he sat back with his feet on the table
163,but the officers of the court the ones present  atticus mr gilmer judge taylor sound asleep and bert were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal
45,i had never seen a packed courtroom so still
133,sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully and a child would scurry out but the grown people sat as if they were in church
83,in the balcony the negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience
133,the old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck the hour eight deafening bongs that shook our bones
169,when it bonged eleven times i was past feeling tired from fighting sleep i allowed myself a short nap against reverend sykess comfortable arm and shoulder
583,i jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so by looking down and concentrating on the heads below there were sixteen bald ones fourteen men that could pass for redheads forty heads varying between brown and black and  i remembered something jem had once explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical research he said if enough people  a stadium full maybe  were to concentrate on one thing such as setting a tree afire in the woods that the tree would ignite of its own accord
166,i toyed with the idea of asking everyone below to concentrate on setting tom robinson free but thought if they were as tired as i it wouldnt work
69,dill was sound asleep his head on jems shoulder and jem was quiet
20,aint it a long time
12, i asked him
30,sure is scout he said happily
59,well from the way you put it itd just take five minutes
25, jem raised his eyebrows
77,there are things you dont understand he said and i was too weary to argue
114,but i must have been reasonably awake or i would not have received the impression that was creeping into me
86,it was not unlike one i had last winter and i shivered though the night was hot
324,the feeling grew until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold february morning when the mockingbirds were still and the carpenters had stopped hammering on miss maudies new house and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the radley place
83,a deserted waiting empty street and the courtroom was packed with people
64,a steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning
144,mr heck tate who had entered the courtroom and was talking to atticus might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket
201,atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung of a chair as he listened to what mr tate was saying he ran his hand slowly up and down his thigh
183,i expected mr tate to say any minute take him mr finch but mr tate said this court will come to order in a voice that rang with authority and the heads below us jerked up
52,mr tate left the room and returned with tom robinson
64,he steered tom to his place beside atticus and stood there
128,judge taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight looking at the empty jury box
190,what happened after that had a dreamlike quality in a dream i saw the jury return moving like underwater swimmers and judge taylors voice came from far away and was tiny
279,i saw something only a lawyers child could be expected to see could be expected to watch for and it was like watching atticus walk into the street raise a rifle to his shoulder and pull the trigger but watching all the time knowing that the gun was empty
132,a jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted and when this jury came in not one of them looked at tom robinson
109,the foreman handed a piece of paper to mr tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judge
14,i shut my eyes
42,judge taylor was polling the jury guilty
152,i peeked at jem his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail and his shoulders jerked as if each guilty was a separate stab between them
35,judge taylor was saying something
51,his gavel was in his fist but he wasnt using it
72,dimly i saw atticus pushing papers from the table into his briefcase
162,he snapped it shut went to the court reporter and said something nodded to mr gilmer and then went to tom robinson and whispered something to him
54,atticus put his hand on toms shoulder as he whispered
84,atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder
56,then he left the courtroom but not by his usual exit
125,he must have wanted to go home the short way because he walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit
59,i followed the top of his head as he made his way to the door
18,he did not look up
170,someone was punching me but i was reluctant to take my eyes from the people below us and from the image of atticus s lonely walk down the aisle
16,miss jean louise
16, i looked around
19,they were standing
101,all around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall the negroes were getting to their feet
90,reverend sykess voice was as distant as judge taylors miss jean louise stand up
20,your fathers passin
61, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  it was jems turn to cry
90,his face was streaked with angry tears as we made our way through the cheerful crowd
103,it aint right he muttered all the way to the corner of the square where we found atticus waiting
222,atticus was standing under the street light looking as though nothing had happened his vest was buttoned his collar and tie were neatly in place his watchchain glistened he was his impassive self again
32,it aint right atticus said jem
23,no son its not right
15, we walked home
31,aunt alexandra was waiting up
98,she was in her dressing gown and i could have sworn she had on her corset underneath it
30,im sorry brother she murmured
110,having never heard her call atticus brother before i stole a glance at jem but he was not listening
150,he would look up at atticus then down at the floor and i wondered if he thought atticus somehow responsible for tom robinsons conviction
14,is he all right
27, aunty asked indicating jem
35,hell be so presently said atticus
37,it was a little too strong for him
19, our father sighed
23,im going to bed he said
47,if i dont wake up in the morning dont call me
108, i didnt think it wise in the first place to let them   this is their home sister said atticus
76,weve made it this way for them they might as well learn to cope with it
122, but they dont have to go to the courthouse and wallow in it   its just as much maycomb county as missionary teas
45, atticus   aunt alexandras eyes were anxious
64,you are the last person i thought would turn bitter over this
25, im not bitter just tired
15,im going to bed
29, atticus   said jem bleakly
25,he turned in the doorway
41, how could they do it how could they
30, i dont know but they did it
133,theyve done it before and they did it tonight and theyll do it again and when they do it  seems that only children weep
47, but things are always better in the morning
121,atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour and was in the livingroom behind the mobile register when we stumbled in
76,jems morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask
82,its not time to worry yet atticus reassured him as we went to the diningroom
20,were not through yet
43,therell be an appeal you can count on that
39,gracious alive cal whats all this
38, he was staring at his breakfast plate
78,calpurnia said tom robinsons daddy sent you along this chicken this morning
97, you tell him im proud to get it  bet they dont have chicken for breakfast at the white house
16,what are these
23, rolls said calpurnia
34,estelle down at the hotel sent em
106, atticus looked up at her puzzled and she said you better step out here and see whats in the kitchen mr
18, we followed him
124,the kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the family hunks of salt pork tomatoes beans even scuppernongs
62,atticus grinned when he found ajar of pickled pigs knuckles
62,reckon auntyll let me eat these in the diningroom
86, calpurnia said this was all round the back steps when i got here this morning
45,they  they preciate what you did mr finch
55,they  they arent oversteppin themselves are they
36, atticus s eyes filled with tears
31,he did not speak for a moment
33,tell them im very grateful he said
55,tell them  tell them they must never do this again
17,times are too hard
123,he left the kitchen went in the diningroom and excused himself to aunt alexandra put on his hat and went to town
95,we heard dills step in the hall so calpurnia left atticuss uneaten breakfast on the table
194,between rabbitbites dill told us of miss rachels reaction to last night which was if a man like atticus finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall its his head
110,fda got her told growled dill gnawing a chicken leg but she didnt look much like tellin this morning
131,said she was up half the night wonderin where i was said sheda had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing
60, dill youve got to stop goin off without tellin her said jem
23,it just aggravates her
24, dill sighed patiently
113,i told her till i was blue in the face where i was goin  shes just seein too many snakes in the closet
93,bet that woman drinks a pint for breakfast every morning  know she drinks two glasses full
50, dont talk like that dill said aunt alexandra
31,its not becoming to a child
11,its  cynical
32, i aint cynical miss alexandra
35,tellin the truths not cynical is it
27, the way you tell it it is
58, jems eyes flashed at her but he said to dill lets go
33,you can take that runner with you
132, when we went to the front porch miss stephanie crawford was busy telling it to miss maudie atkinson and mr avery
49,they looked around at us and went on talking
36,jem made a feral noise in his throat
21,i wished for a weapon
44,i hate grown folks lookin at you said dill
41,makes you feel like youve done something
51, miss maudie yelled for jem finch to come there
48,jem groaned and heaved himself up from the swing
28,well go with you dill said
47,miss stephanies nose quivered with curiosity
174,she wanted to know who all gave us permission to go to court  she didnt see us but it was all over town this morning that we were in the colored balcony
43,did atticus put us up there as a sort of  
49,wasnt it right close up there with all those  
32,did scout understand all the  
43,didnt it make us mad to see our daddy beat
14,hush stephanie
30, miss maudies diction was deadly
143,ive not got all the morning to pass on the porch  jem finch i called to find out if you and your colleagues can eat some cake
52,got up at five to make it so you better say yes
19,excuse us stephanie
16,good morning mr
81, there was a big cake and two little ones on miss maudies kitchen table
38,there should have been three little ones
75,it was not like miss maudie to forget dill and we must have shown it
82,but we understood when she cut from the big cake and gave the slice to jem
130,as we ate we sensed that this was miss maudies way of saying that as far as she was concerned nothing had changed
51,she sat quietly in a kitchen chair watching us
35,suddenly she spoke dont fret jem
40,things are never as bad as they seem
129, indoors when miss maudie wanted to say something lengthy she spread her fingers on her knees and settled her bridgework
29,this she did and we waited
121,i simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us
25,your fathers one of them
12, oh said jem
149, dont you oh well me sir miss maudie replied recognizing jems fatalistic noises you are not old enough to appreciate what i said
39, jem was staring at his halfeaten cake
74,its like bein a caterpillar in a cocoon thats what it is he said
50,like somethin asleep wrapped up in a warm place
102,i always thought maycomb folks were the best folks in the world least thats what they seemed like
55, were the safest folks in the world said miss maudie
110,were so rarely called on to be christians but when we are weve got men like atticus to go for us
21, jem grinned ruefully
46,wish the rest of the county thought that
40, youd be surprised how many of us do
15, jems voice rose
68,who in this town did one thing to help tom robinson just who
53, his colored friends for one thing and people like us
25,people like judge taylor
25,people like mr heck tate
39,stop eating and start thinking jem
99,did it ever strike you that judge taylor naming atticus to defend that boy was no accident
60,that judge taylor might have had his reasons for naming him
20, this was a thought
135,courtappointed defenses were usually given to maxwell green maycomb s latest addition to the bar who needed the experience
49,maxwell green should have had tom robinsons case
44,you think about that miss maudie was saying
19,it was no accident
54,i was sittin there on the porch last night waiting
229,i waited and waited to see you all come down the sidewalk and as i waited i thought atticus finch wont win he cant win but hes the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case like that
95,and i thought to myself well were making a step  its just a baby step but its a step
120, ts all right to talk like that  cant any christian judges an lawyers make up for heathen juries jem muttered
103,soons i get grown   thats something youll have to take up with your father miss maudie said
132,we went down miss maudie s cool new steps into the sunshine and found mr avery and miss stephanie crawford still at it
91,they had moved down the sidewalk and were standing in front of miss stephanies house
36,miss rachel was walking toward them
53,i think ill be a clown when i get grown said dill
34,jem and i stopped in our tracks
22,yes sir a clown he said
135,there aint one thing in this world i can do about folks except laugh so im gonna join the circus and laugh my head off
40, you got it backwards dill said jem
45,clowns are sad its folks that laugh at them
38, well im gonna be a new kind of clown
65,im gonna stand in the middle of the ring and laugh at the folks
30,just looka yonder he pointed
43,every one of em oughta be ridin broomsticks
25,aunt rachel already does
127, miss stephanie and miss rachel were waving wildly at us in a way that did not give the lie to dills observation
19,oh gosh breathed jem
37,i reckon itd be ugly not to see em
20, something was wrong
113,mr avery was red in the face from a sneezing spell and nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up
94,miss stephanie was trembling with excitement and miss rachel caught dills shoulder
56,you get on in the back yard and stay there she said
20,theres danger acomin
19,aint you heard yet
113,its all over town   at that moment aunt alexandra came to the door and called us but she was too late
200,it was miss stephanies pleasure to tell us this morning mr bob ewell stopped atticus on the post office corner spat in his face and told him hed get him if it took the rest of his life
102,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  i wish bob ewell wouldnt chew tobacco was all atticus said about it
176,according to miss stephanie crawford however atticus was leaving the post office when mr ewell approached him cursed him spat on him and threatened to kill him
349,miss stephanie who by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it all  passing by from the jitney jungle she was  miss stephanie said atticus didnt bat an eye just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let mr ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat
187,mr ewell was a veteran of an obscure war that plus atticuss peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire too proud to fight you niggerlovin bastard
102, miss stephanie said atticus said no too old put his hands in his pockets and strolled on
97,miss stephanie said you had to hand it to atticus finch he could be right dry sometimes
37,jem and i didnt think it entertaining
76,after all though i said he was the deadest shot in the county one time
52,he could you know he wouldnt carry a gun scout
32,he aint even got one   said jem
64,you know he didnt even have one down at the jail that night
75,he told me havin a gun arounds an invitation to somebody to shoot you
24, this is different i said
28,we can ask him to borrow one
29, we did and he said nonsense
343, dill was of the opinion that an appeal to atticuss better nature might work after all we would starve if mr ewell killed him besides be raised exclusively by aunt alexandra and we all knew the first thing shed do before atticus was under the ground good would be to fire calpurnia
77,jem said it might work if i cried and flung a fit being young and a girl
23,that didnt work either
173,but when he noticed us dragging around the neighborhood not eating taking little interest in our normal pursuits atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were
153,he tempted jem with a new football magazine one night when he saw jem flip the pages and toss it aside he said whats bothering you son
26, jem came to the point mr
18, what has happened
19, nothings happened
68,were scared for you and we think you oughta do something about him
23, atticus smiled wryly
24,put him under a peace bond
63, when a man says hes gonna get you looks like he means it
43, he meant it when he said it said atticus
56,jem see if you can stand in bob ewells shoes a minute
91,i destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial if he had any to begin with
72,the man had to have some kind of comeback his kind always does
118,so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell one extra beating thats something ill gladly take
104,he had to take it out on somebody and id rather it be me than that houseful of children out there
16,you understand
10, jem nodded
153,aunt alexandra entered the room as atticus was saying we dont have anything to fear from bob ewell he got it all out of his system that morning
49, i wouldnt be so sure of that atticus she said
43,his kindd do anything to pay off a grudge
33,you know how those people are
41, what on earth could ewell do to me sister
43, something furtive aunt alexandra said
22,you may count on that
70, nobody has much chance to be furtive in maycomb atticus answered
30,after that we were not afraid
56,summer was melting away and we made the most of it
202,atticus assured us that nothing would happen to tom robinson until the higher court reviewed his case and that tom had a good chance of going free or at least of having a new trial
72,he was at enfield prison farm seventy miles away in chester county
93,i asked atticus if toms wife and children were allowed to visit him but atticus said no
69,if he loses his appeal i asked one evening whatll happen to him
85, hell go to the chair said atticus unless the governor commutes his sentence
28,not time to worry yet scout
23,weve got a good chance
59, jem was sprawled on the sofa reading popular mechanics
13,he looked up
12,it aint right
47,he didnt kill anybody even if he was guilty
25,he didnt take anybodys life
59, you know rapes a capital offense in alabama said atticus
112,yessir but the jury didnt have to give him death  if they wanted to they couldve gave him twenty years
20, given said atticus
33,tom robinsons a colored man jem
120,no jury in this part of the worlds going to say we think youre guilty but not very on a charge like that
49,it was either a straight acquittal or nothing
26, jem was shaking his head
99,i know its not right but i cant figure out whats wrong  maybe rape shouldnt be a capital offense
50, atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair
231,he said he didnt have any quarrel with the rape statute none what ever but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence
56,he glanced at me saw i was listening and made it easier
111,  i mean before a man is sentenced to death for murder say there should be one or two eyewitnesses
85,some one should be able to say yes i was there and saw him pull the trigger
87, but lots of folks have been hung  hanged  on circumstantial evidence said jem
159,i know and lots of em probably deserved it too  but in the absence of eye witnesses theres always a doubt some times only the shadow of a doubt
95,the law says reasonable doubt but i think a defendants entitled to the shadow of a doubt
77,theres always the possibility no matter how improbable that hes innocent
42, then it all goes back to the jury then
29,we oughta do away with juries
16, jem was adamant
52,atticus tried hard not to smile but couldnt help it
27,youre rather hard on us son
42,i think maybe there might be a better way
14,change the law
94,change it so that only judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases
44, then go up to montgomery and change the law
37, youd be surprised how hard thatd be
91,i wont live to see the law changed and if you live to see it youll be an old man
34, this was not good enough for jem
41,no sir they oughta do away with juries
55,he wasnt guilty in the first place and they said he was
109, if you had been on that jury son and eleven other boys like you tom would be a free man said atticus
74,so far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process
125,those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life toms jury but you saw something come between them and reason
58,you saw the same thing that night in front of the jail
93,when that crew went away they didnt go as reasonable men they went because we were there
107,theres something in our world that makes men lose their heads  they couldnt be fair if they tried
94,in our courts when its a white mans word against a black mans the white man always wins
48,theyre ugly but those are the facts of life
44, doesnt make it right said jem stolidly
36,he beat his fist softly on his knee
60,you just cant convict a man on evidence like that  you cant
40, you couldnt but they could and did
48,the older you grow the more of it youll see
193,the one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom be he any color of the rainbow but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box
305,as you grow older youll see white men cheat black men every day of your life but let me tell you something and dont you forget it  whenever a white man does that to a black man no matter who he is how rich he is or how fine a family he comes from that white man is trash
67, atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears
39,i looked up and his face was vehement
120,theres nothing more sickening to me than a low grade white man wholl take advantage of a negros ignorance
103,dont fool yourselves  its all adding up and one of these days were going to pay the bill for it
38,i hope its not in you childrens time
28, jem was scratching his head
29,suddenly his eyes widened
79,atticus he said why dont people like us and miss maudie ever sit on juries
85,you never see anybody from maycomb on a jury  they all come from out in the woods
43, atticus leaned back in his rockingchair
48,for some reason he looked pleased with jem
52,i was wondering when thatd occur to you he said
26,there are lots of reasons
111,for one thing miss maudie cant serve on a jury because shes a woman you mean women in alabama cant  
16, i was indignant
70,i guess its to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like toms
122,besides atticus grinned i doubt if wed ever get a complete case tried  the ladiesd be interrupting to ask questions
19, jem and i laughed
42,miss maudie on a jury would be impressive
123,i thought of old mrs dubose in her wheelchair  stop that rapping john taylor i want to ask this man something
37, perhaps our forefathers were wise
72,atticus was saying with people like us  thats our share of the bill
41,we generally get the juries we deserve
63,our stout maycomb citizens arent interested in the first place
31,in the second place theyre afraid
25,then theyre   afraid why
145,well what if  say mr link deas had to decide the amount of damages to award say miss maudie when miss rachel ran over her with a car
90,link wouldnt like the thought of losing either ladys business at his store would he
131,so he tells judge taylor that he cant serve on the jury because he doesnt have anybody to keep store for him while hes gone
30,so judge taylor excuses him
40,sometimes he excuses him wrathfully
67, whatd make him think either one of emd stop trading with him
56,jem said miss rachel would miss maudie wouldnt
36,but a jurys votes secret atticus
22, our father chuckled
37,youve many more miles to go son
39,a jurys votes supposed to be secret
102,serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something
21,men dont like to do that
26,sometimes its unpleasant
61, toms jury sho made up its mind in a hurry jem muttered
40,atticuss fingers went to his watchpocket
49,no it didnt he said more to himself than to us
88,that was the one thing that made me think well this may be the shadow of a beginning
26,that jury took a few hours
77,an inevitable verdict maybe but usually it takes em just a few minutes
42,this time   he broke off and looked at us
156,you might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing down  in the beginning he was rarin for an outright acquittal
21, jem was astonished
23,atticuss eyes twinkled
55,its not for me to say but ill tell you this much
38,he was one of your old sarum friends
24, one of the cunninghams
11, jem yelped
36,one of  i didnt recognize any of em
12,youre jokin
51, he looked at atticus from the corners of his eyes
23,one of their connections
31,on a hunch i didnt strike him
15,just on a hunch
19,couldve but i didnt
36, golly moses jem said reverently
87,one minute theyre tryin to kill him and the next theyre tryin to turn him loose
54,ill never understand those folks as long as i live
42, atticus said you just had to know em
114,he said the cunninghams hadnt taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the new world
107,he said the other thing about them was once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail
155,atticus said he had a feeling nothing more than a suspicion that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the finches
106,then too he said it took a thunderbolt plus another cunningham to make one of them change his mind
53,if wed had two of that crowd wedve had a hung jury
113, jem said slowly you mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before
56,how could you take such a risk atticus how could you
46, when you analyze it there was little risk
119,theres no difference between one man whos going to convict and another man whos going to convict is there
131,theres a faint difference between a man whos going to convict and a man whos a little disturbed in his mind isnt there
47,he was the only uncertainty on the whole list
49, what kin was that man to mr walter cunningham
36,atticus rose stretched and yawned
91,it was not even our bedtime but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper
48,he picked it up folded it and tapped my head
35,lets see now he droned to himself
19,double first cousin
17, how can that be
34, two sisters married two brothers
43,thats all ill tell you  you figure it out
152, i tortured myself and decided that if i married jem and dill had a sister whom he married our children would be double first cousins
93,gee minetti jem i said when atticus had gone theyre funny folks d you hear that aunty
82, aunt alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us but she was listening
87,she sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it her rug spread across her lap
81,why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me
19,i heard it she said
108,i remembered the distant disastrous occasion when i rushed to young walter cunninghams defense
24,now i was glad id done it
150,soons school starts im gonna ask walter home to dinner i planned having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time i saw him
51,he can stay over sometimes after school too
43,atticus could drive him back to old sarum
61,maybe he could spend the night with us sometime okay jem
113, well see about that aunt alexandra said a declaration that with her was always a threat never a promise
26,surprised i turned to her
13,why not aunty
18,theyre good folks
44, she looked at me over her sewing glasses
73,jean louise there is no doubt in my mind that theyre good folks
35,but theyre not our kind of folks
42, jem says she means theyre yappy scout
12, whats a yap
40,they like fiddlin and things like that
65, well i do too dont be silly jean louise said aunt alexandra
142,the thing is you can scrub walter cunningham till he shines you can put him in shoes and a new suit but hell never be like jem
60,besides theres a drinking streak in that family a mile wide
53,finch women arent interested in that sort of people
36, aunty said jem she aint nine yet
31, she may as well learn it now
23, aunt alexandra had spoken
69,i was reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down
15,i never knew why
191,it was when i was absorbed with plans to visit calpurnias house  i was curious interested i wanted to be her company to see how she lived who her friends were
68,i might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon
82,this time the tactics were different but aunt alexandras aim was the same
88,perhaps this was why she had come to live with us  to help us choose our friends
103,i would hold her off as long as i could if theyre good folks then why cant i be nice to walter
37, i didnt say not to be nice to him
90,you should be friendly and polite to him you should be gracious to everybody dear
41,but you dont have to invite him home
34, what if he was kin to us aunty
86, the fact is that he is not kin to us but if he were my answer would be the same
241, aunty jem spoke up atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho cant choose your family an theyre still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge em or not and it makes you look right silly when you dont
146, thats your father all over again said aunt alexandra and i still say that jean louise will not invite walter cunningham to this house
153,if he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to see atticus on business
16,now that is that
120, she had said indeed not but this time she would give her reasons but i want to play with walter aunty why cant i
46, she took off her glasses and stared at me
25,ill tell you why she said
57,because  he  is  trash thats why you cant play with him
88,ill not have you around him picking up his habits and learning lordknowswhat
51,youre enough of a problem to your father as it is
58, i dont know what i would have done but jem stopped me
101,he caught me by the shoulders put his arm around me and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom
112,atticus heard us and poked his head around the door s all right sir jem said gruffly s not anything
18, atticus went away
16,have a chew scout
57, jem dug into his pocket and extracted a tootsie roll
88,it took a few minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw
52,jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser
212,his hair stuck up behind and down in front and i wondered if it would ever look like a mans  maybe if he shaved it off and started over his hair would grow back neatly in place
88,his eyebrows were becoming heavier and i noticed a new slimness about his body
22,he was growing taller
140,when he looked around he must have thought i would start crying again for he said show you something if you wont tell anybody
10, i said what
40,he unbuttoned his shirt grinning shyly
22, well cant you see it
13, well its hair
11,right there
88, he had been a comfort to me so i said it looked lovely but i didnt see anything
17,its real nice jem
29, under my arms too he said
30,goin out for football next year
39,scout dont let aunty aggravate you
76, it seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate aunty
72,you know shes not used to girls said jem leastways not girls like you
33,shes trying to make you a lady
35,cant you take up sewin or somethin
64,she doesnt like me thats all there is to it and i dont care
126,it was her callin walter cunningham trash that got me goin jem not what she said about being a problem to atticus
207,we got that all straight one time i asked him if i was a problem and he said not much of one at most one that he could always figure out and not to worry my head a second about botherin him
48,naw it was walter  that boys not trash jem
24,he aint like the ewells
59, jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed
68,he propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light
26,you know something scout
31,ive got it all figured out now
61,ive thought about it a lot lately and ive got it figured out
44,theres four kinds of folks in the world
185,theres the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors theres the kind like the cunninghams out in the woods the kind like the ewells down at the dump and the negroes
76, what about the chinese and the cajuns down yonder in baldwin county
26, i mean in maycomb county
181,the thing about it is our kind of folks dont like the cunninghams the cunninghams dont like the ewells and the ewells hate and despise the colored folks
142, i told jem if that was so then why didnt toms jury made up of folks like the cunninghams acquit tom to spite the ewells
51, jem waved my question away as being infantile
197,you know he said ive seen atticus pat his foot when theres fiddlin on the radio and he loves pot liquor bettern any man i ever saw   then that makes us like the cunninghams i said
91,i cant see why aunty   no lemme finish  it does but were still different somehow
137,atticus said one time the reason auntys so hipped on the family is because all weve gots background and not a dime to our names
170, well jem i dont know  atticus told me one time that most of this old family stuffs foolishness because everybodys familys just as old as everybody elses
78,i said did that include the colored folks and englishmen and he said yes
50, background doesnt mean old family said jem
59,i think its how long your familys been readin and writin
79,scout ive studied this real hard and thats the only reason i can think of
128,somewhere along when the finches were in egypt one of em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy
12, jem laughed
114,imagine aunty being proud her greatgrandaddy could read an write  ladies pick funny things to be proud of
116, well im glad he could or whoda taught atticus and them and if atticus couldnt read you and med be in a fix
44,i dont think thats what background is jem
71, well then how do you explain why the cunninghams are different
52,mr walter can hardly sign his name ive seen him
51,weve just been readin and writin longern they have
49, no everybodys gotta learn nobodys born knowin
131,that walters as smart as he can be he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy
22,nothins wrong with him
47,naw jem i think theres just one kind of folks
44, jem turned around and punched his pillow
43,when he settled back his face was cloudy
60,he was going into one of his declines and i grew wary
56,his brows came together his mouth became a thin line
26,he was silent for a while
65,thats what i thought too he said at last when i was your age
82,if theres just one kind of folks why cant they get along with each other
82,if theyre all alike why do they go out of their way to despise each other
56,scout i think im beginning to understand something
99,i think im beginning to understand why boo radleys stayed shut up in the house all this time
35,its because he wants to stay inside
85, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron
32,she carried a tray of charlotte
58,she backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently
91,i admired the ease and grace with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things
76,so did aunt alexandra i guess because she had let calpurnia serve today
39,august was on the brink of september
90,dill would be leaving for meridian tomorrow today he was off with jem at barkers eddy
157,jem had discovered with angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to swim a skill jem considered necessary as walking
177,they had spent two afternoons at the creek they said they were going in naked and i couldnt come so i divided the lonely hours between calpurnia and miss maudie
101,today aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all over the house
166,from the kitchen i heard mrs grace merriweather giving a report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the mrunas it sounded like to me
373,they put the women out in huts when their time came whatever that was they had no sense of family  i knew thatd distress aunty  they subjected children to terrible ordeals when they were thirteen they were crawling with yaws and earworms they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot and then got drunk on it
65,immediately thereafter the ladies adjourned for refreshments
64,i didnt know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out
159,aunt alexandra told me to join them for refreshments it was not necessary that i attend the business part of the meeting she said itd bore me
183,i was wearing my pink sunday dress shoes and a petticoat and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would have to wash my dress again for tomorrow
34,this had been a busy day for her
20,i decided to stay out
18,can i help you cal
39, i asked wishing to be of some service
32,calpurnia paused in the doorway
111,you be still as a mouse in that corner she said an you can help me load up the trays when i come back
117, the gentle hum of ladies voices grew louder as she opened the door why alexandra i never saw such charlotte
11,just lovely
46,i never can get my crust like this never can
43,whodve thought of little dewberry tarts
17,whoda thought it
43,anybody tell you that the preachers wifes
52,nooo well she is and that other one not walkin yet
57, they became quiet and i knew they had all been served
71,calpurnia returned and put my mothers heavy silver pitcher on a tray
81,this coffee pitchers a curiosity she murmured they dont make em these days
21, can i carry it in
39, if you be careful and dont drop it
57,set it down at the end of the table by miss alexandra
29,down there by the cupsn things
15,shes gonna pour
108, i tried pressing my behind against the door as calpurnia had done but the door didnt budge
34,grinning she held it open for me
20,careful now its heavy
39,dont look at it and you wont spill it
65, my journey was successful aunt alexandra smiled brilliantly
34,stay with us jean louise she said
60,this was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady
259,it was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for refreshments be they baptists or presbyterians which accounted for the presence of miss rachel sober as a judge miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford
121,rather nervous i took a seat beside miss maudie and wondered why ladies put on their hats to go across the street
175,ladies in bunches always filled me with vague apprehension and a firm desire to be elsewhere but this feeling was what aunt alexandra called being spoiled
161, the ladies were cool in fragile pastel prints most of them were heavily powdered but unrouged the only lipstick in the room was tangee natural
93,cutex natural sparkled on their fingernails but some of the younger ladies wore rose
22,they smelled heavenly
129,i sat quietly having conquered my hands by tightly gripping the arms of the chair and waited for someone to speak to me
39,miss maudies gold bridgework twinkled
82,youre mighty dressed up miss jean louise she said where are your britches today
14, under my dress
54, i hadnt meant to be funny but the ladies laughed
95,my cheeks grew hot as i realized my mistake but miss maudie looked gravely down at me
52,she never laughed at me unless i meant to be funny
147,in the sudden silence that followed miss stephanie crawford called from across the room whatcha going to be when you grow up jean louise
33, nome i hadnt thought about it
86, i answered grateful that miss stephanie was kind enough to change the subject
39,hurriedly i began choosing my vocation
99, why shoot i thought you wanted to be a lawyer youve already commenced going to court
24, the ladies laughed again
39,that stephanies a card somebody said
99,miss stephanie was encouraged to pursue the subject dont you want to grow up to be a lawyer
84, miss maudies hand touched mine and i answered mildly enough nome just a lady
203, miss stephanie eyed me suspiciously decided that i meant no impertinence and contented herself with well you wont get very far until you start wearing dresses more often
62, miss maudies hand closed tightly on mine and i said nothing
20,its warmth was enough
88,mrs grace merriweather sat on my left and i felt it would be polite to talk to her
174,mr merriweather a faithful methodist under duress apparently saw nothing personal in singing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
140, it was the general opinion of maycomb however that mrs merriweather had sobered him up and made a reasonably useful citizen of him
74,for certainly mrs merriweather was the most devout lady in maycomb
45,i searched for a topic of interest to her
40,what did you all study this afternoon
48,oh child those poor mrunas she said and was off
40,few other questions would be necessary
108,mrs merriweather s large brown eyes always filled with tears when she considered the oppressed
66,living in that jungle with nobody but j grimes everett she said
71,not a white personll go near em but that saintly j grimes everett
121, mrs merriweather played her voice like an organ every word she said received its full measure the poverty
12,the darkness
53,the immorality  nobody but j grimes everett knows
123,you know when the church gave me that trip to the camp grounds j grimes everett said to me   was he there maam
27,i thought   home on leave
42,j grimes everett said to me he said mrs
93,merriweather you have no conception no conception of what we are fighting over there
26, thats what he said to me
18, i said to him mr
130,everett i said the ladies of the maycomb alabama methodist episcopal church south are behind you one hundred percent
25, thats what i said to him
66,and you know right then and there i made a pledge in my heart
158,i said to myself when i go home im going to give a course on the mrunas and bring j grimes everetts message to maycomb and thats just what im doing
69, when mrs merriweather shook her head her black curls jiggled
46,jean louise she said you are a fortunate girl
73,you live in a christian home with christian folks in a christian town
81,out there in j grimes everetts land theres nothing but sin and squalor
42, sin and squalor  what was that gertrude
78, mrs merriweather turned on her chimes for the lady sitting beside her
59,well i always say forgive and forget forgive and forget
108,thing that church ought to do is help her lead a christian life for those children from here on out
84,some of the men ought to go out there and tell that preacher to encourage her
88, excuse me mrs merriweather i interrupted are you all talking about mayella ewell
17,that darkys wife
31,toms wife tom   robinson maam
53, mrs merriweather turned back to her neighbor
108,theres one thing i truly believe gertrude she continued but some people just dont see it my way
107,if we just let them know we forgive em that weve forgotten it then this whole thing  blow over
67, ah  mrs merriweather i interrupted once more whatll blow over
24, again she turned to me
146,mrs merriweather was one of those childless adults who find it necessary to assume a different tone of voice when speaking to children
182,nothing jean louise she said in stately largo the cooks and field hands are just dissatisfied but theyre settling down now  they grumbled all next day after that trial
116, mrs merriweather faced mrs farrow gertrude i tell you theres nothing more distracting than a sulky darky
30,their mouths go down to here
56,just ruins your day to have one of em in the kitchen
47,you know what i said to my sophy gertrude
66,i said sophy i said you simply are not being a christian today
89,jesus christ never went around grumbling and complaining and you know it did her good
105,she took her eyes off that floor and said nome miz merriweather jesus never went around grumblin
99, i tell you gertrude you never ought to let an opportunity go by to witness for the lord
82, i was reminded of the ancient little organ in the chapel at finchs landing
159,when i was very small and if i had been very good during the day atticus would let me pump its bellows while he picked out a tune with one finger
76,the last note would linger as long as there was air to sustain it
127,mrs merriweather had run out of air i judged and was replenishing her supply while mrs farrow composed herself to speak
73,mrs farrow was a splendidly built woman with pale eyes and narrow feet
89,she had a fresh permanent wave and her hair was a mass of tight gray ringlets
52,she was the second most devout lady in maycomb
92,she had a curious habit of prefacing everything she said with a soft sibilant sound
85,sss grace she said its just like i was telling brother hutson the other day
89,sss brother hutson i said looks like were fighting a losing battle a losing battle
43, i said sss it doesnt matter to em one bit
152,we can educate em till were blue in the face we can try till we drop to make christians out of em but theres no lady safe in her bed these nights
19, he said to me mrs
50,farrow i dont know what were coming to down here
44, sss i told him that was certainly a fact
34, mrs merriweather nodded wisely
129,her voice soared over the clink of coffee cups and the soft bovine sounds of the ladies munching their dainties
89,gertrude she said i tell you there are some good but misguided people in this town
18,good but misguided
60,folks in this town who think theyre doing right i mean
174,now far be it from me to say who but some of em in this town thought they were doing the right thing a while back but all they did was stir em up
20,thats all they did
123,might ve looked like the right thing to do at the time im sure i dont know im not read in that field but sulky
12,dissatisfied
72,i tell you if my sophyd kept it up another day id have let her go
184,its never entered that wool of hers that the only reason i keep her is because this depressions on and she needs her dollar and a quarter every week she can get it
47, his food doesnt stick going down does it
19, miss maudie said it
67,two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth
77,she had been sitting silently beside me her coffee cup balanced on one knee
173,i had lost the thread of conversation long ago when they quit talking about tom robinsons wife and had contented myself with thinking of finchs landing and the river
129,aunt alexandra had got it backwards the business part of the meeting was bloodcurdling the social hour was dreary
70,maudie im sure i dont know what you mean said mrs merriweather
40,im sure you do miss maudie said shortly
16,she said no more
45,when miss maudie was angry her brevity was icy
85,something had made her deeply angry and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice
58,mrs merriweather reddened glanced at me and looked away
30,i could not see mrs farrow
158,aunt alexandra got up from the table and swiftly passed more refreshments neatly engaging mrs merriweather and mrs gates in brisk conversation
85,when she had them well on the road with mrs perkins aunt alexandra stepped back
83,she gave miss maudie a look of pure gratitude and i wondered at the world of women
129,miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close and here was aunty silently thanking her for something
19,for what i knew not
117,i was content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude for help given
161,there was no doubt about it i must soon enter this world where on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly fanned gently and drank cool water
45,but i was more at home in my fathers world
161,people like mr heck tate did not trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you even jem was not highly critical unless you said something stupid
106,ladies seemed to live in faint horror of men seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them
16,but i liked them
209,there was something about them no matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed no matter how undelectable they were there was something about them that i instinctively liked
88,they werent  hypocrites mrs perkins born hypocrites mrs merriweather was saying
60,at least we dont have that sin on our shoulders down here
79,people up there set em free but you dont see em settin at the table with em
104,at least we dont have the deceit to say to em yes youre as good as we are but stay away from us
65,down here we just say you live your way and well live ours
146,i think that woman that mrs roosevelts lost her mind  just plain lost her mind coming down to birmingham and tryin to sit with em
249,if i was the mayor of birmingham id   well neither of us was the mayor of birmingham but i wished i was the governor of alabama for one day id let tom robinson go so quick the missionary society wouldnt have time to catch its breath
153,calpurnia was telling miss rachels cook the other day how bad tom was taking things and she didnt stop talking when i came into the kitchen
283,she said there wasnt a thing atticus could do to make being shut up easier for him that the last thing he said to atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was goodbye mr finch there aint nothin you can do now so there aint no use tryin
101, calpurnia said atticus told her that the day they took tom to prison he just gave up hope
157,she said atticus tried to explain things to him and that he must do his best not to lose hope because atticus was doing his best to get him free
155,miss rachels cook asked calpurnia why didnt atticus just say yes youll go free and leave it at that  seemed like thatd be a big comfort to tom
58,calpurnia said because you aint familiar with the law
109,first thing you learn when youre in a lawin family is that there aint any definite answers to anything
73,mr finch couldnt say somethins so when he doesnt know for sure its so
72, the front door slammed and i heard atticuss footsteps in the hall
48,automatically i wondered what time it was
118,not nearly time for him to be home and on missionary society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark
25,he stopped in the doorway
50,his hat was in his hand and his face was white
26,excuse me ladies he said
62,go right ahead with your meeting dont let me disturb you
53,alexandra could you come to the kitchen a minute
42,i want to borrow calpurnia for a while
122, he didnt go through the diningroom but went down the back hallway and entered the kitchen from the rear door
30,aunt alexandra and i met him
61,the diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined us
39,calpurnia had half risen from her chair
92,cal atticus said i want you to go with me out to helen robinsons house   whats the matter
65, aunt alexandra asked alarmed by the look on my fathers face
45, aunt alexandra put her hands to her mouth
29,they shot him said atticus
13,he was running
35,it was during their exercise period
110,they said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started climbing over
54,right in front of them   didnt they try to stop him
34,didnt they give him any warning
30, aunt alexandras voice shook
39,oh yes the guards called to him to stop
49,they fired a few shots in the air then to kill
47,they got him just as he went over the fence
86,they said if hed had two good arms hed have made it he was moving that fast
31,seventeen bullet holes in him
38,they didnt have to shoot him that much
61,cal i want you to come out with me and help me tell helen
47, yes sir she murmured fumbling at her apron
43,miss maudie went to calpurnia and untied it
51,this is the last straw atticus aunt alexandra said
39,depends on how you look at it he said
63,what was one negro more or less among two hundred of em
54,he wasnt tom to them he was an escaping prisoner
93, atticus leaned against the refrigerator pushed up his glasses and rubbed his eyes
34,we had such a good chance he said
90,i told him what i thought but i couldnt in truth say that we had more than a good chance
82,i guess tom was tired of white mens chances and preferred to take his own
14, then lets go
85, aunt alexandra sat down in calpurnias chair and put her hands to her face
75,she sat quite still she was so quiet i wondered if she would faint
125,i heard miss maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps and in the diningroom the ladies chattered happily
102,i thought aunt alexandra was crying but when she took her hands away from her face she was not
17,she looked weary
31,she spoke and her voice was flat
128,i cant say i approve of everything he does maudie but hes my brother and i just want to know when this will ever end
40, her voice rose it tears him to pieces
63,he doesnt show it much but it tears him to pieces
75,ive seen him when  what else do they want from him maudie what else
30, what does who want alexandra
19, miss maudie asked
16,i mean this town
115,theyre perfectly willing to let him do what theyre too afraid to do themselves  it might lose em a nickel
153,theyre perfectly willing to let him wreck his health doing what theyre afraid to do theyre   be quiet theyll hear you said miss maudie
51,have you ever thought of it this way alexandra
87,whether maycomb knows it or not were paying the highest tribute we can pay a man
26,we trust him to do right
13,its that simple
76, aunt alexandra never knew she was echoing her twelveyearold nephew
306,the handful of people in this town who say that fair play is not marked white only the handful of people who say a fair trial is for everybody not just us the handful of people with enough humility to think when they look at a negro there but for the lords kindness am 
124, miss maudies old crispness was returning the handful of people in this town with background thats who they are
146, had i been attentive i would have had another scrap to add to jems definition of background but i found myself shaking and couldnt stop
93,i had seen enfield prison farm and atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me
35,it was the size of a football field
55,stop that shaking commanded miss maudie and i stopped
42,get up alexandra weve left em long enough
86, aunt alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips
58,she took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose
44,she patted her hair and said do i show it
29, not a sign said miss maudie
32,are you together again jean louise
44, then lets join the ladies she said grimly
74,their voices swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom
91,aunt alexandra was ahead of me and i saw her head go up as she went through the door
55,oh mrs perkins she said you need some more coffee
14,let me get it
72, calpurnias on an errand for a few minutes grace said miss maudie
146,let me pass you some more of those dewberry tarts dyou hear what that cousin of mine did the other day the one who likes to go fishing
228, and so they went down the row of laughing women around the diningroom refilling coffee cups dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia
29,the gentle hum began again
71,yes sir mrs perkins that j grimes everett is a martyred saint he
34,needed to get married so they ran
48,to the beauty parlor every saturday afternoon
27,soon as the sun goes down
25,he goes to bed with the
79,chickens a crate full of sick chickens fred says thats what started it all
63, aunt alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled
73,she looked at a tray of cookies on the table and nodded at them
83,i carefully picked up the tray and watched myself walk to mrs merriweather
67,with my best company manners i asked her if she would have some
69,after all if aunty could be a lady at a time like this so could i
50,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  dont do that scout
28,set him out on the back steps
20, jem are you crazy
41, i said set him out on the back steps
104, sighing i scooped up the small creature placed him on the bottom step and went back to my cot
116,september had come but not a trace of cool weather with it and we were still sleeping on the back screen porch
181,lightning bugs were still about the night crawlers and flying insects that beat against the screen the summer long had not gone wherever they go when autumn comes
133,a rolypoly had found his way inside the house i reasoned that the tiny varmint had crawled up the steps and under the door
66,i was putting my book on the floor beside my cot when i saw him
121,the creatures are no more than an inch long and when you touch them they roll themselves into a tight gray ball
50,i lay on my stomach reached down and poked him
12,he rolled up
49,then feeling safe i suppose he slowly unrolled
79,he traveled a few inches on his hundred legs and i touched him again
12,he rolled up
41,feeling sleepy i decided to end things
50,my hand was going down on him when jem spoke
17,jem was scowling
117,it was probably a part of the stage he was going through and i wished he would hurry up and get through it
108,he was certainly never cruel to animals but i had never known his charity to embrace the insect world
22,why couldnt i mash him
59,because they dont bother you jem answered in the darkness
38,he had turned out his reading light
101,reckon youre at the stage now where you dont kill flies and mosquitoes now i reckon i said
37,lemme know when you change your mind
80,tell you one thing though i aint gonna sit around and not scratch a redbug
33, aw dry up he answered drowsily
74,jem was the one who was getting more like a girl every day not i
93,comfortable i lay on my back and waited for sleep and while waiting i thought of dill
218,he had left us the first of the month with firm assurances that he would return the minute school was out  he guessed his folks had got the general idea that he liked to spend his summers in maycomb
144,miss rachel took us with them in the taxi to maycomb junction and dill waved to us from the train window until he was out of sight
38,he was not out of mind i missed him
93,the last two days of his time with us jem had taught him to swim  taught him to swim
51,i was wide awake remembering what dill had told me
99,barkers eddy is at the end of a dirt road off the meridian highway about a mile from town
303,it is easy to catch a ride down the highway on a cotton wagon or from a passing motorist and the short walk to the creek is easy but the prospect of walking all the way back home at dusk when the traffic is light is tiresome and swimmers are careful not to stay too late
103,according to dill he and jem had just come to the highway when they saw atticus driving toward them
55,he looked like he had not seen them so they both waved
107,atticus finally slowed down when they caught up with him he said youd better catch a ride back
33,i wont be going home for a while
31, calpurnia was in the back seat
107,jem protested then pleaded and atticus said all right you can come with us if you stay in the car
73, on the way to tom robinsons atticus told them what had happened
131,they turned off the highway rode slowly by the dump and past the ewell residence down the narrow lane to the negro cabins
84,dill said a crowd of black children were playing marbles in toms front yard
40,atticus parked the car and got out
49,calpurnia followed him through the front gate
67,dill heard him ask one of the children wheres your mother sam
57, and heard sam say she down at sis stevenss mr finch
24,want me run fetch her
80, dill said atticus looked uncertain then he said yes and sam scampered off
57,go on with your game boys atticus said to the children
73,a little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at atticus
85,dill said her hair was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails each ending in a bright bow
106,she grinned from ear to ear and walked toward our father but she was too small to navigate the steps
83,dill said atticus went to her took off his hat and offered her his finger
50,she grabbed it and he eased her down the steps
29,then he gave her to calpurnia
61,sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up
62,dill said helen said evenin mr finch wont you have a seat
27, but she didnt say any more
21,neither did atticus
50,scout said dill she just fell down in the dirt
104,just fell down in the dirt like a giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her
43,just ump   dills fat foot hit the ground
24,like youd step on an ant
108, dill said calpurnia and atticus lifted helen to her feet and half carried half walked her to the cabin
62,they stayed inside a long time and atticus came out alone
114,when they drove back by the dump some of the ewells hollered at them but dill didnt catch what they said
151,maycomb was interested by the news of toms death for perhaps two days two days was enough for the information to spread through the county
20,did you hear about
89,well they say he was runnin fit to beat lightnin  to maycomb toms death was typical
37,typical of a nigger to cut and run
124,typical of a niggers mentality to have no plan no thought for the future just run blind first chance he saw
69,funny thing atticus finch might ve got him off scot free but wait  
22,you know how they are
17,easy come easy go
196,just shows you that robinson boy was legally married they say he kept himself clean went to church and all that but when it comes down to the line the veneers mighty thin
30,nigger always comes out in em
171,a few more details enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn then nothing to talk about until the maycomb tribune appeared the following thursday
86,there was a brief obituary in the colored news but there was also an editorial
120,b underwood was at his most bitter and he couldnt have cared less who canceled advertising and subscriptions
173,but maycomb didnt play that way mr underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to hed still get his advertising and subscriptions
85,if he wanted to make a fool of himself in his paper that was his business
109, mr underwood didnt talk about miscarriages of justice he was writing so children could understand
105,mr underwood simply figured it was a sin to kill cripples be they standing sitting or escaping
224,he likened toms death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children and maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical enough to be reprinted in the montgomery advertiser
73,how could this be so i wondered as i read mr underwoods editorial
210,senseless killing  tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death he had been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true my father had fought for him all the way
191,then mr underwoods meaning became clear atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson but in the secret courts of mens hearts atticus had no case
79,tom was a dead man the minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed
40,the name ewell gave me a queasy feeling
187,maycomb had lost no time in getting mr ewells views on toms demise and passing them along through that english channel of gossip miss stephanie crawford
91,miss stephanie told aunt alexandra in jems presence oh foot hes old enough to listen
67, that mr ewell said it made one down and about two more to go
72,jem told me not to be afraid mr ewell was more hot gas than anything
154,jem also told me that if i breathed a word to atticus if in any way i let atticus know i knew jem would personally never speak to me again
104,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  school started and so did our daily trips past the radley place
263,jem was in the seventh grade and went to high school beyond the grammarschool building i was now in the third grade and our routines were so different i only walked to school with jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes
122,he went out for football but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team water buckets
83,this he did with enthusiasm most afternoons he was seldom home before dark
140,the radley place had ceased to terrify me but it was no less gloomy no less chilly under its great oaks and no less uninviting
167,mr nathan radley could still be seen on a clear day walking to and from town we knew boo was there for the same old reason  nobodyd seen him carried out yet
327,i sometimes felt a twinge of remorse when passing by the old place at ever having taken part in what must have been sheer torment to arthur radley  what reasonable recluse wants children peeping through his shutters delivering greetings on the end of a fishing pole wandering in his collards at night
21,and yet i remembered
94,two indianhead pennies chewing gum soap dolls a rusty medal a broken watch and chain
38,jem must have put them away somewhere
99,i stopped and looked at the tree one afternoon the trunk was swelling around its cement patch
37,the patch itself was turning yellow
76,we had almost seen him a couple of times a good enough score for anybody
52,but i still looked for him each time i went by
33,maybe someday we would see him
100,i imagined how it would be when it happened hed just be sitting in the swing when i came along
83,hidy do mr arthur i would say as if i had said it every afternoon of my life
138,evening jean louise he would say as if he had said it every afternoon of my life right pretty spell were having isnt it
46, yes sir right pretty i would say and go on
20,it was only a fantasy
23,we would never see him
90,he probably did go out when the moon was down and gaze upon miss stephanie crawford
68,id have picked somebody else to look at but that was his business
27,he would never gaze at us
41,you arent starting that again are you
129, said atticus one night when i expressed a stray desire just to have one good look at boo radley before i died
45,if you are ill tell you right now stop it
58,im too old to go chasing you off the radley property
21,besides its dangerous
18,you might get shot
100,you know mr nathan shoots at every shadow he sees even shadows that leave sizefour bare footprints
36,you were lucky not to be killed
25, i hushed then and there
40,at the same time i marveled at atticus
103,this was the first he had let us know he knew a lot more about something than we thought he knew
30,and it had happened years ago
50,no only last summer  no summer before last when
31,time was playing tricks on me
27,i must remember to ask jem
74,so many things had happened to us boo radley was the least of our fears
245,atticus said he didnt see how anything else could happen that things had a way of settling down and after enough time passed people would forget that tom robinsons existence was ever brought to their attention
99,perhaps atticus was right but the events of the summer hung over us like smoke in a closed room
287,the adults in maycomb never discussed the case with jem and me it seemed that they discussed it with their children and their attitude must have been that neither of us could help having atticus for a parent so their children must be nice to us in spite of him
238,the children would never have thought that up for themselves had our classmates been left to their own devices jem and i would have had several swift satisfying fistfights apiece and ended the matter for good
101,as it was we were compelled to hold our heads high and be respectively a gentleman and a lady
98,in a way it was like the era of mrs henry lafayette dubose without all her yelling
223,there was one odd thing though that i never understood in spite of atticus s shortcomings as a parent people were content to reelect him to the state legislature that year as usual without opposition
146,i came to the conclusion that people were just peculiar i withdrew from them and never thought about them until i was forced to
32,i was forced to one day in school
48,once a week we had a current events period
120,each child was supposed to clip an item from a newspaper absorb its contents and reveal them to the class
346,this practice allegedly overcame a variety of evils standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise delivering a short talk made him wordconscious learning his current event strengthened his memory being singled out made him more than ever anxious to return to the group
72,the idea was profound but as usual in maycomb it didnt work very well
241,in the first place few rural children had access to newspapers so the burden of current events was borne by the town children convincing the bus children more deeply that the town children got all the attention anyway
174,the rural children who could usually brought clippings from what they called the grit paper a publication spurious in the eyes of miss gates our teacher
319,why she frowned when a child recited from the grit paper i never knew but in some way it was associated with liking fiddling eating syrupy biscuits for lunch being a holyroller singing sweetly sings the donkey and pronouncing it dunkey all of which the state paid teachers to discourage
64,even so not many of the children knew what a current event was
211,little chuck little a hundred years old in his knowledge of cows and their habits was halfway through an uncle natchell story when miss gates stopped him charles that is not a current event
26,that is an advertisement
39, cecil jacobs knew what one was though
117,when his turn came he went to the front of the room and began old hitler   adolf hitler cecil said miss gates
35,one never begins with old anybody
17, yes maam he said
65,old adolf hitler has been prosecutin the   persecuting cecil
296, nome miss gates it says here  well anyway old adolf hitler has been after the jews and hes puttin em in prisons and hes taking away all their property and he wont let any of em out of the country and hes washin all the feeble minded and   washing the feebleminded
140, yes maam miss gates i reckon they dont have sense enough to wash themselves i dont reckon an idiot could keep hisself clean
234,well anyway hitlers started a program to round up all the half jews too and he wants to register em in case they might wanta cause him any trouble and i think this is a bad thing and thats my current event
34, very good cecil said miss gates
38,puffing cecil returned to his seat
43,a hand went up in the back of the room
16,how can he do that
12, who do what
28, asked miss gates patiently
148,i mean how can hitler just put a lot of folks in a pen like that looks like the govamintd stop him said the owner of the hand
137,hitler is the government said miss gates and seizing an opportunity to make education dynamic she went to the blackboard
40,she printed democracy in large letters
18,democracy she said
32,does anybody have a definition
20, us somebody said
94,i raised my hand remembering an old campaign slogan atticus had once told me about
41,what do you think it means jean louise
61, equal rights for all special privileges for none i quoted
52,very good jean louise very good miss gates smiled
46,in front of democracy she printed we are a
51,now class say it all together we are a democracy
12, we said it
80,then miss gates said thats the difference between america and germany
51,we are a democracy and germany is a dictatorship
22,dictatorship she said
50,over here we dont believe in persecuting anybody
50,persecution comes from people who are prejudiced
40,prejudice she enunciated carefully
118,there are no better people in the world than the jews and why hitler doesnt think so is a mystery to me
107, an inquiring soul in the middle of the room said why dont they like the jews you reckon miss gates
18, i dont know henry
108,they contribute to every society they live in and most of all they are a deeply religious people
91,hitlers trying to do away with religion so maybe he doesnt like them for that reason
15, cecil spoke up
127,well i dont know for certain he said theyre supposed to change money or somethin but that aint no cause to persecute em
21,theyre white aint they
180, miss gates said when you get to high school cecil youll learn that the jews have been persecuted since the beginning of history even driven out of their own country
53,its one of the most terrible stories in history
30,time for arithmetic children
81, as i had never liked arithmetic i spent the period looking out the window
104,the only time i ever saw atticus scowl was when elmer davis would give us the latest on hitler
47,atticus would snap off the radio and say hmp
98, i asked him once why he was impatient with hitler and atticus said because hes a maniac
71, this would not do i mused as the class proceeded with its sums
40,one maniac and millions of german folks
94,looked to me like theyd shut hitler in a pen instead of letting him shut them up
64,there was something else wrong  i would ask my father about it
101,i did and he said he could not possibly answer my question because he didnt know the answer
29,but its okay to hate hitler
20, it is not he said
27,its not okay to hate anybody
53, atticus i said theres somethin i dont understand
128,miss gates said it was awful hitler doin like he does she got real red in the face about it   i should think she would
11, nothing sir
140, i went away not sure that i could explain to atticus what was on my mind not sure that i could clarify what was only a feeling
39,perhaps jem could provide the answer
50,jem understood school things better than atticus
44,jem was worn out from a days watercarrying
106,there were at least twelve banana peels on the floor by his bed surrounding an empty milk bottle
19,whatcha stuffin for
91,coach says if i can gain twentyfive pounds by year after next i can play he said
25,this is the quickest way
29, if you dont throw it all up
40,jem i said i wanta ask you somethin
48, he put down his book and stretched his legs
37,miss gates is a nice lady aint she
18, why sure said jem
35,i liked her when i was in her room
46, she hates hitler a lot whats wrong with that
79, well she went on today about how bad it was him treatin the jews like that
44,jem its not right to persecute anybody is it
51,i mean have mean thoughts about anybody even is it
17, gracious no scout
16,whats eatin you
205, well coming out of the courthouse that night miss gates was  she was goin down the steps in front of us you musta not seen her  she was talking with miss stephanie crawford
167,i heard her say its time somebody taught em a lesson they were gettin way above themselves an the next thing they think they can do is marry us
137,jem how can you hate hitler so bad an then turn around and be ugly about folks right at home   jem was suddenly furious
67,he leaped off the bed grabbed me by the collar and shook me
74,i never wanta hear about that courthouse again ever ever you hear me
11,you hear me
57,dont you ever say one word to me about it again you hear
29, i was too surprised to cry
86,i crept from jems room and shut the door softly lest undue noise set him off again
29,suddenly tired i wanted atticus
82,he was in the livingroom and i went to him and tried to get in his lap
14,atticus smiled
69,youre getting so big now ill just have to hold a part of you
19, he held me close
49,scout he said softly dont let jem get you down
36,hes having a rough time these days
24,i heard you back there
182, atticus said that jem was trying hard to forget something but what he was really doing was storing it away for a while until enough time passed
71,then he would be able to think about it and sort things out
63,when he was able to think about it jem would be himself again
107,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  things did settle down after a fashion as atticus said they would
105,by the middle of october only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two maycomb citizens
110,no there were three things and they did not directly concern us  the finches  but in a way they did
258,the first thing was that mr bob ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteenthirties he was the only man i ever heard of who was fired from the wpa for laziness
199,i suppose his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry but his job lasted only as long as his notoriety mr ewell found himself as forgotten as tom robinson
264,thereafter he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare office for his check and received it with no grace amid obscure mutterings that the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldnt permit an honest man to make a living
88,ruth jones the welfare lady said mr ewell openly accused atticus of getting his job
78,she was upset enough to walk down to atticuss office and tell him about it
135,atticus told miss ruth not to fret that if bob ewell wanted to discuss atticuss getting his job he knew the way to the office
44,the second thing happened to judge taylor
66,judge taylor was not a sundaynight churchgoer mrs taylor was
219,judge taylor savored his sunday night hour alone in his big house and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the writings of bob taylor no kin but the judge would have been proud to claim it
157,one sunday night lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction judge taylors attention was wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise
57,hush he said to ann taylor his fat nondescript dog
122,then he realized he was speaking to an empty room the scratching noise was coming from the rear of the house
101,judge taylor clumped to the back porch to let ann out and found the screen door swinging open
100,a shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye and that was all he saw of his visitor
140,mrs taylor came home from church to find her husband in his chair lost in the writings of bob taylor with a shotgun across his lap
58,the third thing happened to helen robinson toms widow
102,if mr ewell was as forgotten as tom robinson tom robinson was as forgotten as boo radley
56,but tom was not forgotten by his employer mr link deas
33,mr link deas made a job for helen
94,he didnt really need her but he said he felt right bad about the way things turned out
69,i never knew who took care of her children while helen was away
217,calpurnia said it was hard on helen because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to avoid the ewells who according to helen chunked at her the first time she tried to use the public road
161,mr link deas eventually received the impression that helen was coming to work each morning from the wrong direction and dragged the reason out of her
49,just let it be mr link please suh helen begged
26,the hell i will said mr link
69,he told her to come by his store that afternoon before she left
96,she did and mr link closed his store put his hat firmly on his head and walked helen home
45,he walked her the short way by the ewells
57,on his way back mr link stopped at the crazy gate
11,i say ewell
59, the windows normally packed with children were empty
64,i know every last one of yous in there alayin on the floor
153,now hear me bob ewell if i hear one more peep outa my girl helen about not bein able to walk this road ill have you in jail before sundown
45, mr link spat in the dust and walked home
61,helen went to work next morning and used the public road
136,nobody chunked at her but when she was a few yards beyond the ewell house she looked around and saw mr ewell walking behind her
129,she turned and walked on and mr ewell kept the same distance behind her until she reached mr link deass house
100,all the way to the house helen said she heard a soft voice behind her crooning foul words
101,thoroughly frightened she telephoned mr link at his store which was not too far from his house
73,as mr link came out of his store he saw mr ewell leaning on the fence
62,mr ewell said dont you look at me link deas like i was dirt
107,i aint jumped your   first thing you can do ewell is get your stinkin carcass off my property
57,youre leanin on it an i cant afford fresh paint for it
165,second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or ill have you up for assault   i aint touched her link deas and aint about to go with no nigger
210, you dont have to touch her all you have to do is make her afraid an if assault aint enough to keep you locked up awhile ill get you in on the ladies law so get outa my sight
59,if you dont think i mean it just bother that girl again
80, mr ewell evidently thought he meant it for helen reported no further trouble
102,i dont like it atticus i dont like it at all was aunt alexandras assessment of these events
98,that man seems to have a permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case
145,i know how that kind are about paying off grudges but i dont understand why he should harbor one  he had his way in court didnt he
36, i think i understand said atticus
124,it might be because he knows in his heart that very few people in maycomb really believed his and mayellas yarns
56,he thought hed be a hero but all he got for his pain was
60,was okay well convict this negro but get back to your dump
81,hes had his fling with about everybody now so he ought to be satisfied
45,hell settle down when the weather changes
55, but why should he try to burgle john taylors house
65,he obviously didnt know john was home or he wouldntve tried
99,only lights john shows on sunday nights are on the front porch and back in his den
89, you dont know if bob ewell cut that screen you dont know who did it said atticus
16,but i can guess
57,i proved him a liar but john made him look like a fool
98,all the time ewell was on the stand i couldnt dare look at john and keep a straight face
74,john looked at him as if he were a threelegged chicken or a square egg
68,dont tell me judges dont try to prejudice juries atticus chuckled
96,by the end of october our lives had become the familiar routine of school play study
162,jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to forget and our classmates mercifully let us forget our fathers eccentricities
64,cecil jacobs asked me one time if atticus was a radical
104,when i asked atticus atticus was so amused i was rather annoyed but he said he wasnt laughing at me
68,he said you tell cecil im about as radical as cotton tom heflin
33, aunt alexandra was thriving
115,miss maudie must have silenced the whole missionary society at one blow for aunty again ruled that roost
46,her refreshments grew even more delicious
183,i learned more about the poor mrunas social life from listening to mrs merriweather they had so little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family
111,a child had as many fathers as there were men in the community as many mothers as there were women
114,j grimes everett was doing his utmost to change this state of affairs and desperately needed our prayers
25,maycomb was itself again
95,precisely the same as last year and the year before that with only two minor changes
112,firstly people had removed from their store windows and automobiles the stickers that said nra we do our part
91,i asked atticus why and he said it was because the national recovery act was dead
44,i asked who killed it he said nine old men
88,the second change in maycomb since last year was not one of national significance
78,until then halloween in maycomb was a completely unorganized affair
180,each child did what he wanted to do with assistance from other children if there was anything to be moved such as placing a light buggy on top of the livery stable
117,but parents thought things went too far last year when the peace of miss tutti and miss frutti was shattered
136,misses tutti and frutti barber were maiden ladies sisters who lived together in the only maycomb residence boasting a cellar
98,the barber ladies were rumored to be republicans having migrated from clanton alabama in 
214,their ways were strange to us and why they wanted a cellar nobody knew but they wanted one and they dug one and they spent the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it
110,misses tutti and frutti their names were sarah and frances aside from their yankee ways were both deaf
225,miss tutti denied it and lived in a world of silence but miss frutti not about to miss anything employed an ear trumpet so enormous that jem declared it was a loudspeaker from one of those dog victrolas
321,with these facts in mind and halloween at hand some wicked children had waited until the misses barber were thoroughly asleep slipped into their livingroom nobody but the radleys locked up at night stealthily made away with every stick of furniture therein and hid it in the cellar
39,i deny having taken part in such a thing
84, was the cry that awoke the misses barbers neighbors at dawn next morning
37,heard em drive a truck up to the door
29,stomped around like horses
28,theyre in new orleans by now
119, miss tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days ago had purloined their furniture
24,dark they were she said
27, mr heck tate was summoned
65,he surveyed the area and said he thought it was a local job
174,miss frutti said shed know a maycomb voice anywhere and there were no maycomb voices in that parlor last night  rolling their rs all over her premises they were
240,nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture miss tutti insisted so mr tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road round up the county hounds and put them on the trail
168,mr tate started them off at the misses barbers front steps but all they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar door
81,when mr tate set them in motion three times he finally guessed the truth
149,by noontime that day there was not a barefooted child to be seen in maycomb and nobody took off his shoes until the hounds were returned
67,so the maycomb ladies said things would be different this year
171,the highschool auditorium would be open there would be a pageant for the grownups apple bobbing taffypulling pinning the tail on the donkey for the children
111,there would also be a prize of twentyfive cents for the best halloween costume created by the wearer
24,jem and i both groaned
76,not that wed ever done anything it was the principle of the thing
149,jem considered himself too old for halloween anyway he said he wouldnt be caught anywhere near the high school at something like that
42,oh well i thought atticus would take me
87,i soon learned however that my services would be required on stage that evening
133,mrs grace merriweather had composed an original pageant entitled maycomb county ad astra per aspera and i was to be a ham
390,she thought it would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to represent the countys agricultural products cecil jacobs would be dressed up to look like a cow agnes boone would make a lovely butterbean another child would be a peanut and on down the line until mrs merriweather s imagination and the supply of children were exhausted
188,our only duties as far as i could gather from our two rehearsals were to enter from stage left as mrs merriweather not only the author but the narrator identified us
43,when she called out pork that was my cue
199,then the assembled company would sing maycomb county maycomb county we will aye be true to thee as the grand finale and mrs merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag
40,my costume was not much of a problem
82,mrs crenshaw the local seamstress had as much imagination as mrs merriweather
91,mrs crenshaw took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham
85,this she covered with brown cloth and painted it to resemble the original
82,i could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my head
26,it came almost to my knees
56,mrs crenshaw thoughtfully left two peepholes for me
20,she did a fine job
50,jem said i looked exactly like a ham with legs
168,there were several discomforts though it was hot it was a close fit if my nose itched i couldnt scratch and once inside i could not get out of it alone
127,when halloween came i assumed that the whole family would be present to watch me perform but i was disappointed
129,atticus said as tactfully as he could that he just didnt think he could stand a pageant tonight he was all in
80,he had been in montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon
47,he thought jem might escort me if i asked him
188,aunt alexandra said she just had to get to bed early shed been decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn out  she stopped short in the middle of her sentence
68,she closed her mouth then opened it to say something but no words came
14,s matter aunty
69,oh nothing nothing she said somebody just walked over my grave
168, she put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension and suggested that i give the family a preview in the livingroom
160,so jem squeezed me into my costume stood at the livingroom door called out poork exactly as mrs merriweather would have done and i marched in
42,atticus and aunt alexandra were delighted
78,i repeated my part for calpurnia in the kitchen and she said i was wonderful
117,i wanted to go across the street to show miss maudie but jem said shed probably be at the pageant anyway
55,after that it didnt matter whether they went or not
26,jem said he would take me
43,thus began our longest journey together
110,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  the weather was unusually warm for the last day of october
25,we didnt even need jackets
92,the wind was growing stronger and jem said it might be raining before we got home
16,there was no moon
72,the street light on the corner cast sharp shadows on the radley house
26,i heard jem laugh softly
38,bet nobody bothers them tonight he said
75,jem was carrying my ham costume rather awkwardly as it was hard to hold
39,i thought it gallant of him to do so
37,it is a scary place though aint it
70,boo doesnt mean anybody any harm but im right glad youre along
77, you know atticus wouldnt let you go to the schoolhouse by yourself jem said
65,dont see why its just around the corner and across the yard
81, that yards a mighty long place for little girls to cross at night jem teased
27,aint you scared of haints
11, we laughed
105,haints hot steams incantations secret signs had vanished with our years as mist with sunrise
104,what was that old thing jem said angel bright lifeindeath get off the road dont suck my breath
21, cut it out now i said
38,we were in front of the radley place
33,jem said boo must not be at home
293, high above us in the darkness a solitary mocker poured out his repertoire in blissful unawareness of whose tree he sat in plunging from the shrill kee kee of the sunflower bird to the irascible quaack of a bluejay to the sad lament of poor will poor will poor will
70,we turned the corner and i tripped on a root growing in the road
73,jem tried to help me but all he did was drop my costume in the dust
56,i didnt fall though and soon we were on our way again
56,we turned off the road and entered the schoolyard
19,it was pitch black
35,how do you know where were at jem
40, i asked when we had gone a few steps
82,i can tell were under the big oak because were passin through a cool spot
34,careful now and dont fall again
110, we had slowed to a cautious gait and were feeling our way forward so as not to bump into the tree
108,the tree was a single and ancient oak two children could not reach around its trunk and touch hands
135,it was far away from teachers their spies and curious neighbors it was near the radley lot but the radleys were not curious
108,a small patch of earth beneath its branches was packed hard from many fights and furtive crap games
113,the lights in the high school auditorium were blazing in the distance but they blinded us if anything
31,dont look ahead scout jem said
42,look at the ground and you wont fall
47, you should have brought the flashlight jem
29, didnt know it was this dark
58,didnt look like itd be this dark earlier in the evening
20,so cloudy thats why
27,itll hold off a while though
23, someone leaped at us
12,god almighty
11, jem yelled
85,a circle of light burst in our faces and cecil jacobs jumped in glee behind it
13,ha aa gotcha
13, he shrieked
38,thought youd be comin along this way
50, what are you doin way out here by yourself boy
28,aint you scared of boo radley
177, cecil had ridden safely to the auditorium with his parents hadnt seen us then had ventured down this far because he knew good and well wed be coming along
38,he thought mr finchd be with us though
52,shucks aint much but around the corner said jem
37,whos scared to go around the corner
54, we had to admit that cecil was pretty good though
103,he had given us a fright and he could tell it all over the schoolhouse that was his privilege
31,say i said aint you a cow tonight
18,wheres your costume
33, its up behind the stage he said
66,mrs merriweather says the pageant aint comin on for a while
88,you can put yours back of the stage by mine scout and we can go with the rest of em
41, this was an excellent idea jem thought
71,he also thought it a good thing that cecil and i would be together
61,this way jem would be left to go with people his own age
160,when we reached the auditorium the whole town was there except atticus and the ladies worn out from decorating and the usual outcasts and shutins
98,most of the county it seemed was there the hall was teeming with slickedup country people
137,the high school building had a wide downstairs hallway people milled around booths that had been installed along each side
44,i forgot my money i sighed when i saw them
22,atticus didnt jem said
43,heres thirty cents you can do six things
16,see you later on
60, okay i said quite content with thirty cents and cecil
99,i went with cecil down to the front of the auditorium through a door on one side and backstage
204,i got rid of my ham costume and departed in a hurry for mrs merriweather was standing at a lectern in front of the first row of seats making lastminute frenzied changes in the script
24,how much money you got
14, i asked cecil
48,cecil had thirty cents too which made us even
289,we squandered our first nickels on the house of horrors which scared us not at all we entered the black seventhgrade room and were led around by the temporary ghoul in residence and were made to touch several objects alleged to be component parts of a human being
77,heres his eyes we were told when we touched two peeled grapes on a saucer
44,heres his heart which felt like raw liver
83,these are his innards and our hands were thrust into a plate of cold spaghetti
37,cecil and i visited several booths
65,we each bought a sack of mrs judge taylors homemade divinity
63,i wanted to bob for apples but cecil said it wasnt sanitary
97,his mother said he might catch something from everybodys heads having been in the same tub
57,aint anything around town now to catch i protested
71,but cecil said his mother said it was unsanitary to eat after folks
114,i later asked aunt alexandra about this and she said people who held such views were usually climbers
143,we were about to purchase a blob of taffy when mrs merriweather s runners appeared and told us to go backstage it was time to get ready
259,the auditorium was filling with people the maycomb county high school band had assembled in front below the stage the stage footlights were on and the red velvet curtain rippled and billowed from the scurrying going on behind it
186,backstage cecil and i found the narrow hallway teeming with people adults in homemade threecorner hats confederate caps spanishamerican war hats and world war helmets
99,children dressed as various agricultural enterprises crowded around the one small window
47,somebodys mashed my costume i wailed in dismay
89,mrs merriweather galloped to me reshaped the chicken wire and thrust me inside
28,you all right in there scout
13, asked cecil
65,you sound so far off like you was on the other side of a hill
34, you dont sound any nearer i said
70,the band played the national anthem and we heard the audience rise
26,then the bass drum sounded
104,mrs merriweather stationed behind her lectern beside the band said maycomb county ad astra per aspera
29, the bass drum boomed again
100,that means said mrs merriweather translating for the rustic elements from the mud to the stars
57, she added unnecessarily it seemed to me a pageant
115, reckon they wouldnt know what it was if she didnt tell em whispered cecil who was immediately shushed
34,the whole town knows it i breathed
47,but the country folksve come in cecil said
63,be quiet back there a mans voice ordered and we were silent
76,the bass drum went boom with every sentence mrs merriweather uttered
310,she chanted mournfully about maycomb county being older than the state that it was a part of the mississippi and alabama territories that the first white man to set foot in the virgin forests was the probate judges greatgrandfather five times removed who was never heard of again
74,then came the fearless colonel maycomb for whom the county was named
219,andrew jackson appointed him to a position of authority and colonel maycomb s misplaced selfconfidence and slender sense of direction brought disaster to all who rode with him in the creek indian wars
129,colonel maycomb persevered in his efforts to make the region safe for democracy but his first campaign was his last
79,his orders relayed to him by a friendly indian runner were to move south
385,after consulting a tree to ascertain from its lichen which way was south and taking no lip from the subordinates who ventured to correct him colonel maycomb set out on a purposeful journey to rout the enemy and entangled his troops so far northwest in the forest primeval that they were eventually rescued by settlers moving inland
78,mrs merriweather gave a thirtyminute description of colonel maycombs exploits
95,i discovered that if i bent my knees i could tuck them under my costume and more or less sit
109,i sat down listened to mrs merriweathers drone and the bass drums boom and was soon fast asleep
196,they said later that mrs merriweather was putting her all into the grand finale that she had crooned poork with a confidence born of pine trees and butterbeans entering on cue
48,she waited a few seconds then called poork
49, when nothing materialized she yelled pork
208, i must have heard her in my sleep or the band playing dixie woke me but it was when mrs merriweather triumphantly mounted the stage with the state flag that i chose to make my entrance
77,chose is incorrect i thought id better catch up with the rest of them
192,they told me later that judge taylor went out behind the auditorium and stood there slapping his knees so hard mrs taylor brought him a glass of water and one of his pills
144,mrs merriweather seemed to have a hit everybody was cheering so but she caught me backstage and told me i had ruined her pageant
77,she made me feel awful but when jem came to fetch me he was sympathetic
76,he said he couldnt see my costume much from where he was sitting
162,how he could tell i was feeling bad under my costume i dont know but he said i did all right i just came in a little late that was all
96,jem was becoming almost as good as atticus at making you feel right when things went wrong
143,almost  not even jem could make me go through that crowd and he consented to wait backstage with me until the audience left
29,you wanta take it off scout
32,naw ill just keep it on i said
41,i could hide my mortification under it
23,you all want a ride home
14, someone asked
35,no sir thank you i heard jem say
21,its just a little walk
40, be careful of haints the voice said
54,better still tell the haints to be careful of scout
46, there arent many folks left now jem told me
72, we went through the auditorium to the hallway then down the steps
23,it was still black dark
120,the remaining cars were parked on the other side of the building and their headlights were little help
74,if some of em were goin in our direction we could see better said jem
42,here scout let me hold onto your  hock
28,you might lose your balance
18, i can see all right
44, yeah but you might lose your balance
95, i felt a slight pressure on my head and assumed that jem had grabbed that end of the ham
67, we began crossing the black schoolyard straining to see our feet
63,jem i said i forgot my shoes theyre back behind the stage
21, well lets go get em
63, but as we turned around the auditorium lights went off
31,you can get em tomorrow he said
62,but tomorrows sunday i protested as jem turned me homeward
37,you can get the janitor to let you in
39, jem hadnt started that in a long time
31,i wondered what he was thinking
63,hed tell me when he wanted to probably when we got home
63,i felt his fingers press the top of my costume too hard it seemed
16,i shook my head
63,jem you dont hafta hush a minute scout he said pinching me
24,we walked along silently
15,minutes up i said
21,whatcha thinkin about
69, i turned to look at him but his outline was barely visible
41,thought i heard something he said
13,stop a minute
12, we stopped
13,hear anything
61, we had not gone five paces before he made me stop again
30,jem are you tryin to scare me
74,you know im too old   be quiet he said and i knew he was not joking
20,the night was still
49,i could hear his breath coming easily beside me
129,occasionally there was a sudden breeze that hit my bare legs but it was all that remained of a promised windy night
46,this was the stillness before a thunderstorm
11,we listened
34,heard an old dog just then i said
25,its not that jem answered
74,i hear it when were walkin along but when we stop i dont hear it
30, you hear my costume rustlin
167,aw its just halloween got you i said it more to convince myself than jem for sure enough as we began walking i heard what he was talking about
23,it was not my costume
38,its just old cecil said jem presently
21,he wont get us again
39,lets dont let him think were hurrying
22, we slowed to a crawl
111,i asked jem how cecil could follow us in this dark looked to me like hed bump into us from behind
29,i can see you scout jem said
16,i cant see you
29, your fat streaks are showin
91,mrs crenshaw painted em with some of that shiny stuff so theyd show up under the footlights
100,i can see you pretty well an i expect cecil can see you well enough to keep his distance
80, i would show cecil that we knew he was behind us and we were ready for him
32,cecil jacobs is a big wet heen
32, i yelled suddenly turning around
93,there was no acknowledgement save heen bouncing off the distant schoolhouse wall
22,ill get him said jem
47, hayehayehayey answered the schoolhouse wall
103,it was unlike cecil to hold out for so long once he pulled a joke hed repeat it time and again
38,we should have been leapt at already
34,jem signaled for me to stop again
53,he said softly scout can you take that thing off
54, i think so but i aint got anything on under it much
27, ive got your dress here
31, i cant get it on in the dark
24, okay he said never mind
21, jem are you afraid
37,think were almost to the tree now
47,few yards from that an well be to the road
34,we can see the street light then
56, jem was talking in an unhurried flat toneless voice
68,i wondered how long he would try to keep the cecil myth going
30,you reckon we oughta sing jem
26,be real quiet again scout
32, we had not increased our pace
161,jem knew as well as i that it was difficult to walk fast without stumping a toe tripping on stones and other inconveniences and i was barefooted
41,maybe it was the wind rustling the trees
75,but there wasnt any wind and there werent any trees except the big oak
74,our company shuffled and dragged his feet as if wearing heavy shoes
155,whoever it was wore thick cotton pants what i thought were trees rustling was the soft swish of cotton on cotton wheek wheek with every step
85,i felt the sand go cold under my feet and i knew we were near the big oak
21,jem pressed my head
23,we stopped and listened
52,shufflefoot had not stopped with us this time
43,his trousers swished softly and steadily
16,then they stopped
60,he was running running toward us with no childs steps
13, jem screamed
106,i took one giant step and found myself reeling my arms useless in the dark i could not keep my balance
18,jem jem help me jem
50, something crushed the chicken wire around me
125,metal ripped on metal and i fell to the ground and rolled as far as i could floundering to escape my wire prison
112,from somewhere near by came scuffling kicking sounds sounds of shoes and flesh scraping dirt and roots
42,someone rolled against me and i felt jem
148,he was up like lightning and pulling me with him but though my head and shoulders were free i was so entangled we didnt get very far
104,we were nearly to the road when i felt jems hand leave me felt him jerk backwards to the ground
80,more scuffling and there came a dull crunching sound and jem screamed
78,i ran in the direction of jems scream and sank into a flabby male stomach
18,its owner said uff
66, and tried to catch my arms but they were tightly pinioned
52,his stomach was soft but his arms were like steel
42,he slowly squeezed the breath out of me
17,i could not move
87,suddenly he was jerked backwards and flung on the ground almost carrying me with him
17,i thought jems up
41,ones mind works very slowly at times
28,stunned i stood there dumbly
83,the scuffling noises were dying someone wheezed and the night was still again
76,still but for a man breathing heavily breathing heavily and staggering
54,i thought he went to the tree and leaned against it
51,he coughed violently a sobbing bone shaking cough
53, there was no answer but the mans heavy breathing
19, jem didnt answer
63,the man began moving around as if searching for something
63,i heard him groan and pull something heavy along the ground
82,it was slowly coming to me that there were now four people under the tree
72, the man was walking heavily and unsteadily toward the road
112,i went to where i thought he had been and felt frantically along the ground reaching out with my toes
27,presently i touched someone
111, my toes touched trousers a belt buckle buttons something i could not identify a collar and a face
58,a prickly stubble on the face told me it was not jems
25,i smelled stale whiskey
72,i made my way along in what i thought was the direction of the road
64,i was not sure because i had been turned around so many times
50,but i found it and looked down to the street light
27,a man was passing under it
97,the man was walking with the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him
30,he was going around the corner
20,he was carrying jem
48,jems arm was dangling crazily in front of him
76,by the time i reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard
136,light from our front door framed atticus for an instant he ran down the steps and together he and the man took jem inside
60,i was at the front door when they were going down the hall
38,aunt alexandra was running to meet me
49, atticus s voice came sharply from jems room
12,wheres scout
81, here she is aunt alexandra called pulling me along with her to the telephone
27,she tugged at me anxiously
44,im all right aunty i said you better call
81, she pulled the receiver from the hook and said eula may get dr reynolds quick
27, agnes is your father home
19,oh god where is he
63,please tell him to come over here as soon as he comes in
17,please its urgent
103, there was no need for aunt alexandra to identify herself people in maycomb knew each others voices
30,atticus came out of jems room
87,the moment aunt alexandra broke the connection atticus took the receiver from her
69,he rattled the hook then said eula may get me the sheriff please
13,atticus finch
34,someones been after my children
35,between here and the schoolhouse
19,i cant leave my boy
60,run out there for me please and see if hes still around
66,doubt if youll find him now but id like to see him if you do
13,got to go now
11,thanks heck
22, atticus is jem dead
59,look after her sister he called as he went down the hall
96,aunt alexandras fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire from around me
26,are you all right darling
52, she asked over and over as she worked me free
27,it was a relief to be out
84,my arms were beginning to tingle and they were red with small hexagonal marks
38,i rubbed them and they felt better
19,aunty is jem dead
32, no  no darling hes unconscious
66,we wont know how badly hes hurt until dr reynolds gets here
26,jean louise what happened
10, i dont know
20, she left it at that
171,she brought me something to put on and had i thought about it then i would have never let her forget it in her distraction aunty brought me my overalls
81,put these on darling she said handing me the garments she most despised
67,she rushed back to jems room then came to me in the hall
49,she patted me vaguely and went back to jems room
39,a car stopped in front of the house
58,i knew dr reynoldss step almost as well as my fathers
207,he had brought jem and me into the world had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time jem fell out of the treehouse and he had never lost our friendship
100,dr reynolds said if we had been boilprone things would have been different but we doubted it
41,he came in the door and said good lord
77, he walked toward me said youre still standing and changed his course
32,he knew every room in the house
53,he also knew that if i was in bad shape so was jem
45,after ten forevers dr reynolds returned
11,is jem dead
44,far from it he said squatting down to me
64,hes got a bump on the head just like yours and a broken arm
62,scout look that way  no dont turn your head roll your eyes
21,now look over yonder
69,hes got a bad break so far as i can tell now its in the elbow
40,like somebody tried to wring his arm off
13,now look at me
20, then hes not dead
30, dr reynolds got to his feet
85,we cant do much tonight he said except try to make him as comfortable as we can
114,well have to xray his arm  looks like hell be wearing his arm way out by his side for a while
44,dont worry though hell be as good as new
20,boys his age bounce
132, while he was talking dr reynolds had been looking keenly at me lightly fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead
38,you dont feel broke anywhere do you
44, dr reynoldss small joke made me smile
35,then you dont think hes dead then
20, he put on his hat
59,now i may be wrong of course but i think hes very alive
31,shows all the symptoms of it
77,go have a look at him and when i come back well get together and decide
41, dr reynoldss step was young and brisk
22,mr heck tates was not
147,his heavy boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly but he said the same thing dr reynolds said when he came in
21,you all right scout
32,yes sir im goin in to see jem
22,atticusn thems in there
30, ill go with you said mr tate
84,aunt alexandra had shaded jems reading light with a towel and his room was dim
26,jem was lying on his back
50,there was an ugly mark along one side of his face
91,his left arm lay out from his body his elbow was bent slightly but in the wrong direction
17,jem was frowning
15, atticus spoke
46,he cant hear you scout hes out like a light
57,he was coming around but dr reynolds put him out again
12, i retreated
32,jems room was large and square
65,aunt alexandra was sitting in a rockingchair by the fireplace
85,the man who brought jem in was standing in a corner leaning against the wall
41,he was some countryman i did not know
87,he had probably been at the pageant and was in the vicinity when it happened
52,he must have heard our screams and come running
34,atticus was standing by jems bed
36,mr heck tate stood in the doorway
76,his hat was in his hand and a flashlight bulged from his pants pocket
32,he was in his working clothes
27,come in heck said atticus
21,did you find anything
97,i cant conceive of anyone lowdown enough to do a thing like this but i hope you found him
16, mr tate sniffed
150,he glanced sharply at the man in the corner nodded to him then looked around the room  at jem at aunt alexandra then at atticus
39,sit down mr finch he said pleasantly
30,atticus said lets all sit down
21,have that chair heck
41,ill get another one from the livingroom
33, mr tate sat in jems desk chair
57,he waited until atticus returned and settled himself
146,i wondered why atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the corner but atticus knew the ways of country people far better than i
170,some of his rural clients would park their longeared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the back yard and atticus would often keep appointments on the back steps
53,this one was probably more comfortable where he was
48,mr finch said mr tate tell you what i found
57,i found a little girls dress  its out there in my car
21,that your dress scout
49, yes sir if its a pink one with smockin i said
54,mr tate was behaving as if he were on the witness stand
110,he liked to tell things his own way untrammeled by state or defense and sometimes it took him a while
77,i found some funnylooking pieces of muddycolored cloth   thats mcostume mr
41, mr tate ran his hands down his thighs
110,he rubbed his left arm and investigated jems mantelpiece then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace
35,his fingers sought his long nose
15,what is it heck
13, said atticus
40,mr tate found his neck and rubbed it
106,bob ewells lyin on the ground under that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs
11,hes dead mr
96, contents  p rev  n ext chapter  aunt alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece
40,mr tate rose but she declined assistance
86,for once in his life atticuss instinctive courtesy failed him he sat where he was
115,somehow i could think of nothing but mr bob ewell saying hed get atticus if it took him the rest of his life
60,mr ewell almost got him and it was the last thing he did
12,are you sure
22, atticus said bleakly
34,hes dead all right said mr tate
16,hes good and dead
35,he wont hurt these children again
18, i didnt mean that
46, atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep
295,his age was beginning to show his one sign of inner turmoil the strong line of his jaw melted a little one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears one noticed not his jetblack hair but the gray patches growing at his temples
35,hadnt we better go to the livingroom
31, aunt alexandra said at last
83,if you dont mind said mr tate id rather us stay in here if it wont hurt jem any
54,i want to have a look at his injuries while scout
18,tells us about it
30, is it all right if i leave
36,im just one person too many in here
42,ill be in my room if you want me atticus
63, aunt alexandra went to the door but she stopped and turned
82,atticus i had a feeling about this tonight  i  this is my fault she began
39,i should have   mr tate held up his hand
67,you go ahead miss alexandra i know its been a shock to you
138,and dont you fret yourself about anything  why if we followed our feelings all the time wed be like cats chasin their tails
99,miss scout see if you can tell us what happened while its still fresh in your mind
16,you think you can
30,did you see him following you
51, i went to atticus and felt his arms go around me
31,i buried my head in his lap
15,we started home
30,i said jem ive forgot mshoes
50,soons we started back for em the lights went out
34,jem said i could get em tomorrow
56, scout raise up so mr tate can hear you atticus said
25,i crawled into his lap
28,then jem said hush a minute
110,i thought he was thinkin  he always wants you to hush so he can think  then he said he heard somethin
22,we thought it was cecil
12, cecil jacobs
60,he scared us once tonight an we thought it was him again
16,he had on a sheet
120,they gave a quarter for the best costume i dont know who won it where were you when you thought it was cecil
45, just a little piece from the schoolhouse
45,i yelled somethin at him   you yelled what
39, cecil jacobs is a big fat hen i think
131,we didnt hear nothin  then jem yelled hello or somethin loud enough to wake the dead   just a minute scout said mr tate
26,mr finch did you hear them
23, atticus said he didnt
18,he had the radio on
49,aunt alexandra had hers going in her bedroom
89,he remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she could hear hers
16,atticus smiled
34,i always play a radio too loud
44, i wonder if the neighbors heard anything
13, said mr tate
15,i doubt it heck
70,most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the chickens
49,maudie atkinson may have been up but i doubt it
31, go ahead scout mr tate said
35,well after jem yelled we walked on
70,mr tate i was shut up in my costume but i could hear it myself then
15,footsteps i mean
60,they walked when we walked and stopped when we stopped
97,jem said he could see me because mrs crenshaw put some kind of shiny paint on my costume
11,i was a ham
24, asked mr tate startled
80,atticus described my role to mr tate plus the construction of my garment
77,you should have seen her when she came in he said it was crushed to a pulp
23, mr tate rubbed his chin
94,i wondered why he had those marks on him his sleeves were perforated with little holes
83,there were one or two little puncture marks on his arms to match the holes
37,let me see that thing if you will sir
48, atticus fetched the remains of my costume
86,mr tate turned it over and bent it around to get an idea of its former shape
44,this thing probably saved her life he said
35, he pointed with a long forefinger
50,a shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire
42,bob ewell meant business mr tate muttered
37,he was out of his mind said atticus
66,dont like to contradict you mr finch  wasnt crazy mean as hell
89,lowdown skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children
35,hed never have met you face to face
22, atticus shook his head
131,i cant conceive of a man whod   mr finch theres just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say hidy to em
60,even then they aint worth the bullet it takes to shoot em
19,ewell as one of em
76, atticus said i thought he got it all out of him the day he threatened me
48,even if he hadnt i thought hed come after me
209, he had guts enough to pester a poor colored woman he had guts enough to pester judge taylor when he thought the house was empty so do you think he da met you to your face in daylight
16, mr tate sighed
17,wed better get on
43,scout you heard him behind you   yes sir
107,when we got under the tree   howd you know you were under the tree you couldnt see thunder out there
77, i was barefooted and jem says the grounds always cooler under a tree
42, well have to make him a deputy go ahead
69, then all of a sudden somethin grabbed me an mashed my costume
28,think i ducked on the ground
40,heard a tusslin under the tree sort of
49,they were bammin against the trunk sounded like
53,jem found me and started pullin me toward the road
41,some  mr ewell yanked him down i reckon
80,they tussled some more and then there was this funny noise  jem hollered
18,that was jems arm
129,anyway jem hollered and i didnt hear him any more an the next thing  mr ewell was tryin to squeeze me to death i reckon
35,then somebody yanked mr ewell down
30,jem must have got up i guess
16,thats all i know
40, mr tate was looking at me sharply
67,somebody was staggerin around and pantin and  coughing fit to die
108,i thought it was jem at first but it didnt sound like him so i went lookin for jem on the ground
76,i thought atticus had come to help us and had got wore out   who was it
52, why there he is mr tate he can tell you his name
135, as i said it i half pointed to the man in the corner but brought my arm down quickly lest atticus reprimand me for pointing
24,it was impolite to point
44,he was still leaning against the wall
96,he had been leaning against the wall when i came into the room his arms folded across his chest
100,as i pointed he brought his arms down and pressed the palms of his hands against the wall
183,they were white hands sickly white hands that had never seen the sun so white they stood out garishly against the dull cream wall in the dim light of jems room
126,i looked from his hands to his sandstained khaki pants my eyes traveled up his thin frame to his torn denim shirt
76,his face was as white as his hands but for a shadow on his jutting chin
204,his cheeks were thin to hollowness his mouth was wide there were shallow almost delicate indentations at his temples and his gray eyes were so colorless i thought he was blind
67,his hair was dead and thin almost feathery on top of his head
142,when i pointed to him his palms slipped slightly leaving greasy sweat streaks on the wall and he hooked his thumbs in his belt
155,a strange small spasm shook him as if he heard fingernails scrape slate but as i gazed at him in wonder the tension slowly drained from his face
96,his lips parted into a timid smile and our neighbors image blurred with my sudden tears
15,hey boo i said
88,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  mr arthur honey said atticus gently correcting me
39,jean louise this is mr arthur radley
31,i believe he already knows you
109, if atticus could blandly introduce me to boo radley at a time like this well  that was atticus
116,boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where jem was sleeping for the same shy smile crept across his face
60,hot with embarrassment i tried to cover up by covering jem up
35,ahah dont touch him atticus said
77,mr heck tate sat looking intently at boo through his hornrimmed glasses
64,he was about to speak when dr reynolds came down the hall
47,everybody out he said as he came in the door
60,evenin arthur didnt notice you the first time i was here
214, dr reynoldss voice was as breezy as his step as though he had said it every evening of his life an announcement that astounded me even more than being in the same room with boo radley
44,even boo radley got sick sometimes i thought
34,but on the other hand i wasnt sure
62,dr reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper
52,he put it down on jems desk and took off his coat
39,youre quite satisfied hes alive now
21,tell you how i knew
44,when i tried to examine him he kicked me
53,had to put him out good and proper to touch him
22,so scat he said to me
33,er   said atticus glancing at boo
39,heck lets go out on the front porch
69,there are plenty of chairs out there and its still warm enough
111, i wondered why atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of the livingroom then i understood
42,the livingroom lights were awfully strong
94,we filed out first mr tate  atticus was waiting at the door for him to go ahead of him
43,then he changed his mind and followed mr tate
85,people have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest conditions
101,i was no exception come along mr arthur i heard myself saying you dont know the house real well
33,ill just take you to the porch sir
36, he looked down at me and nodded
53,i led him through the hall and past the livingroom
36,wont you have a seat mr arthur
43,this rockingchairs nice and comfortable
83, my small fantasy about him was alive again he would be sitting on the porch
51,right pretty spell were having isnt it mr arthur
26,yes a right pretty spell
90,feeling slightly unreal i led him to the chair farthest from atticus and mr tate
20,it was in deep shadow
48,boo would feel more comfortable in the dark
77,atticus was sitting in the swing and mr tate was in a chair next to him
62,the light from the livingroom windows was strong on them
18,i sat beside boo
88,well heck atticus was saying i guess the thing to do  good lord im losing my memory
72, atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his eyes
69,jems not quite thirteen no hes already thirteen  i cant remember
56,anyway itll come before county court   what will mr
48, mr tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward
145,of course it was clearcut self defense but ill have to go to the office and hunt up mr finch do you think jem killed bob ewell
18,do you think that
52, you heard what scout said theres no doubt about it
108,she said jem got up and yanked him off her  he probably got hold of ewell s knife somehow in the dark
23,well find out tomorrow
36, mister finch hold on said mr tate
29,jem never stabbed bob ewell
32, atticus was silent for a moment
55,he looked at mr tate as if he appreciated what he said
29,but atticus shook his head
130,heck its mighty kind of you and i know youre doing it from that good heart of yours but dont start anything like that
54, mr tate got up and went to the edge of the porch
98,he spat into the shrubbery then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced atticus
84,im sorry if i spoke sharply heck atticus said simply but nobodys hushing this up
21,i dont live that way
37, nobodys gonna hush anything up mr
135, mr tates voice was quiet but his boots were planted so solidly on the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there
111,a curious contest the nature of which eluded me was developing between my father and the sheriff
66,it was atticuss turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch
44,he said hrm and spat dryly into the yard
49,he put his hands in his pockets and faced mr tate
59,heck you havent said it but i know what youre thinking
16,thank you for it
33,jean louise   he turned to me
37,you said jem yanked mr ewell off you
29, yes sir thats what i thought
15,i see there heck
124,thank you from the bottom of my heart but i dont want my boy starting out with something like this over his head
65,best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open
42,let the county come and bring sandwiches
108,i dont want him growing up with a whisper about him i dont want anybody saying jem finch
47,his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that
43, sooner we get this over with the better
66, mr finch mr tate said stolidly bob ewell fell on his knife
17,he killed himself
44, atticus walked to the corner of the porch
32,he looked at the wisteria vine
63,in his own way i thought each was as stubborn as the other
36,i wondered who would give in first
109,atticuss stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident but in some ways he was as set as the cunninghams
71,mr tates was unschooled and blunt but it was equal to my fathers
30,heck atticuss back was turned
98,if this things hushed up itll be a simple denial to jem of the way ive tried to raise him
74,sometimes i think im a total failure as a parent but im all theyve got
113,before jem looks at anyone else he looks at me and ive tried to live so i can look squarely back at him
130,if i connived at something like this frankly i couldnt meet his eye and the day i cant do that ill know ive lost him
63,i dont want to lose him and scout because theyre all ive got
49, mr tate was still planted to the floorboards
28,bob ewell fell on his knife
15,i can prove it
24, atticus wheeled around
28,his hands dug into his pockets
41,heck cant you even try to see it my way
49,youve got children of your own but im older than you
134,when mine are grown ill be an old man if im still around but right now im  if they dont trust me they wont trust anybody
32,jem and scout know what happened
107,if they hear of me saying downtown something different happened  heck i wont have them any more
56,i cant live one way in town and another way in my home
142, mr tate rocked on his heels and said patiently hed flung jem down he stumbled over a root under that tree and  look i can show you
80, mr tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade knife
43,as he did so dr reynolds came to the door
75,the son  deceaseds under that tree doctor just inside the schoolyard
17,got a flashlight
21,better have this one
104, i can ease around and turn my car lights on said dr reynolds but he took mr tates flashlight
15,jems all right
45,he wont wake up tonight i hope so dont worry
34,that the knife that killed him heck
20, no sir still in him
46,looked like a kitchen knife from the handle
64,ken oughta be there with the hearse by now doctor night
35, mr tate flicked open the knife
26,it was like this he said
115,he held the knife and pretended to stumble as he leaned forward his left arm went down in front of him
57,stabbed himself through that soft stuff between his ribs
33,his whole weight drove it in
62, mr tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket
31,scout is eight years old he said
44,she was too scared to know exactly what went on
40, youd be surprised atticus said grimly
92,im not sayin she made it up im sayin she was too scared to know exactly what happened
38,it was mighty dark out there black as ink
75,d take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness
35, i wont have it atticus said softly
36,god damn it im not thinking of jem
91, mr tates boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in miss maudies bedroom went on
40,miss stephanie crawfords lights went on
68,atticus and mr tate looked across the street then at each other
10,they waited
55,when mr tate spoke again his voice was barely audible
53,mr finch i hate to fight you when youre like this
75,youve been under a strain tonight no man should ever have to go through
208,why you aint in the bed from it i dont know but i do know that for once you havent been able to put two and two together and weve got to settle this tonight because tomorrowh be too late
50,bob ewells got a kitchen knife in his craw
210, mr tate added that atticus wasnt going to stand there and maintain that any boy jems size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark
70,heck said atticus abruptly that was a switchblade you were waving
18,whered you get it
56, took it off a drunk man mr tate answered coolly
25,i was trying to remember
18,mr ewell was on me
15,then he went down
22,jem must have gotten up
20,at least i thought
59, i said i took it off a drunk man downtown tonight
66,ewell probably found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere
33,honed it down and bided his time
19,just bided his time
49, atticus made his way to the swing and sat down
46,his hands dangled limply between his knees
31,he was looking at the floor
167,he had moved with the same slowness that night in front of the jail when i thought it took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair
43,mr tate clumped softly around the porch
44,it aint your decision mr finch its all mine
41,its my decision and my responsibility
72,for once if you dont see it my way theres not much you can do about it
50,if you wanta try ill call you a liar to your face
107,your boy never stabbed bob ewell he said slowly didnt come near a mile of it and now you know it
63,all he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely home
23, mr tate stopped pacing
58,he stopped in front of atticus and his back was to us
66,im not a very good man sir but i am sheriff of maycomb county
75,lived in this town all my life an im goin on fortythree years old
62,know everything thats happened here since before i was born
80,theres a black boy dead for no reason and the man responsible for its dead
45,let the dead bury the dead this time mr finch
28,let the dead bury the dead
54, mr tate went to the swing and picked up his hat
30,it was lying beside atticus
50,mr tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on
247,i never heard tell that its against the law for a citizen to do his utmost to prevent a crime from being committed which is exactly what he did but maybe youll say its my duty to tell the town all about it and not hush it up
22,know whatd happen then
109,all the ladies in maycomb includin my wifed be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes
182,to my way of thinkin mr finch taking the one man whos done you and this town a great service an draggin him with his shy ways into the limelight  to me thats a sin
51,its a sin and im not about to have it on my head
43,if it was any other man itd be different
20,but not this man mr
81, mr tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot
49,he pulled his nose then he massaged his left arm
115,i may not be much mr finch but im still sheriff of maycomb county and bob ewell fell on his knife
15,good night sir
70, mr tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard
36,his car door slammed and he drove away
53,atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time
26,finally he raised his head
41,scout he said mr ewell fell on his knife
30,can you possibly understand
48, atticus looked like he needed cheering up
62,i ran to him and hugged him and kissed him with all my might
42,yes sir i understand i reassured him
17,mr tate was right
45, atticus disengaged himself and looked at me
18,what do you mean
62, well itd be sort of like shootin a mockingbird wouldnt it
48, atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it
102,when he got up and walked across the porch into the shadows his youthful step had returned
68,before he went inside the house he stopped in front of boo radley
42,thank you for my children arthur he said
142,contents  p rev  n ext chapter  when boo radley shuffled to his feet light from the livingroom windows glistened on his forehead
140,every move he made was uncertain as if he were not sure his hands and feet could make proper contact with the things he touched
85,he coughed his dreadful raling cough and was so shaken he had to sit down again
71,his hand searched for his hip pocket and he pulled out a handkerchief
49,he coughed into it then he wiped his forehead
128,having been so accustomed to his absence i found it incredible that he had been sitting beside me all this time present
25,he had not made a sound
31,once more he got to his feet
55,he turned to me and nodded toward the front door
58,youd like to say good night to jem wouldnt you mr arthur
13,come right in
22, i led him down the hall
39,aunt alexandra was sitting by jems bed
24,come in arthur she said
15,hes still asleep
41,dr reynolds gave him a heavy sedative
48,jean louise is your father in the livingroom
20, yes maam i think so
35, ill just go speak to him a minute
21,dr reynolds left some
23, her voice trailed away
111,boo had drifted to a corner of the room where he stood with his chin up peering from a distance at jem
71,i took him by the hand a hand surprisingly warm for its whiteness
72,i tugged him a little and he allowed me to lead him to jems bed
145,dr reynolds had made a tentlike arrangement over jems arm to keep the cover off i guess and boo leaned forward and looked over it
95,an expression of timid curiosity was on his face as though he had never seen a boy before
77,his mouth was slightly open and he looked at jem from head to foot
52,boos hand came up but he let it drop to his side
37,you can pet him mr arthur hes asleep
58,you couldnt if he was awake though he wouldnt let you
27, i found myself explaining
35, boos hand hovered over jems head
21,go on sir hes asleep
43, his hand came down lightly on jems hair
44,i was beginning to learn his body english
69,his hand tightened on mine and he indicated that he wanted to leave
63,i led him to the front porch where his uneasy steps halted
70,he was still holding my hand and he gave no sign of letting me go
23,will you take me home
75, he almost whispered it in the voice of a child afraid of the dark
45,i put my foot on the top step and stopped
70,i would lead him through our house but i would never lead him home
45,mr arthur bend your arm down here like that
14,thats right sir
45, i slipped my hand into the crook of his arm
214,he had to stoop a little to accommodate me but if miss stephanie crawford was watching from her upstairs window she would see arthur radley escorting me down the sidewalk as any gentleman would do
158,we came to the street light on the corner and i wondered how many times dill had stood there hugging the fat pole watching waiting hoping
136,i wondered how many times jem and i had made this journey but i entered the radley front gate for the second time in my life
49,boo and i walked up the steps to the porch
36,his fingers found the front doorknob
97,he gently released my hand opened the door went inside and shut the door behind him
20,i never saw him again
96,neighbors bring food with death and flowers with sickness and little things in between
21,boo was our neighbor
103,he gave us two soap dolls a broken watch and chain a pair of goodluck pennies and our lives
29,but neighbors give in return
103,we never put back into the tree what we took out of it we had given him nothing and it made me sad
21,i turned to go home
61,street lights winked down the street all the way to town
53,i had never seen our neighborhood from this angle
148,there were miss maudies miss stephanies  there was our house i could see the porch swing  miss rachels house was beyond us plainly visible
27,i could even see mrs duboses
19,i looked behind me
61,to the left of the brown door was a long shuttered window
55,i walked to it stood in front of it and turned around
63,in daylight i thought you could see to the postoffice corner
33,in my mind the night faded
44,it was daytime and the neighborhood was busy
87,miss stephanie crawford crossed the street to tell the latest to miss rachel
33,miss maudie bent over her azaleas
121,it was summertime and two children scampered down the sidewalk toward a man approaching in the distance
58,the man waved and the children raced each other to him
55,it was still summertime and the children came closer
71,a boy trudged down the sidewalk dragging a fishingpole behind him
49,a man stood waiting with his hands on his hips
141,summertime and his children played in the front yard with their friend enacting a strange little drama of their own invention
86,it was fall and his children fought on the sidewalk in front of mrs duboses
69,the boy helped his sister to her feet and they made their way home
113,fall and his children trotted to and fro around the corner the days woes and triumphs on their faces
63,they stopped at an oak tree delighted puzzled apprehensive
98,winter and his children shivered at the front gate silhouetted against a blazing house
77,winter and a man walked into the street dropped his glasses and shot a dog
49,summer and he watched his childrens heart break
43,autumn again and boos children needed him
17,atticus was right
108,one time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them
48,just standing on the radley porch was enough
68,the street lights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling
167,as i made my way home i felt very old but when i looked at the tip of my nose i could see fine misty beads but looking crosseyed made me dizzy so i quit
70,as i made my way home i thought what a thing to tell jem tomorrow
63,hed be so mad he missed it he wouldnt speak to me for days
138,as i made my way home i thought jem and i would get grown but there wasnt much else left for us to learn except possibly algebra
39,i ran up the steps and into the house
63,aunt alexandra had gone to bed and atticuss room was dark
39,i would see if jem might be reviving
45,atticus was in jems room sitting by his bed
21,he was reading a book
16,is jem awake yet
